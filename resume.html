    <h2>What I am looking for</h2>
    <p>I work best on projects that are three to six months long. I am the
      ideal consultant if your team is begining a transition to Vue
    and you want to help guarantee their success. I've spent the last year
    and a half going hard and deep with Vue solving real world problems, and so
    I'm going to be a great resouce for your team to come up to speed quickly.</p>
    <p>I can be particularly usefull if you are an entrapranuer just starting
    out and have design goals that you are not certain how to tranlate into code.
    I am comfortable being the first engineer on a project and have put diverse
    teams together who then consistendly ship code</p>

      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p>
        I am a senior full stack engineer with tons of expericene in the trenches
        architecting, building, shipping and maintaining web applicatations.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am emotionally intelligent, self-motivated, and fun to work with.
        I tend to facilitate a work enviroment where we enjoy
        bringing our best work to the table. I am driven by a desire to write
        quality code using best practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        This last couple of years have been about finding my best workflow for
        software development. I discovered I needed time alone, and long walks
        to think through what I was building. Mental models are critical to
        original thinking, and free'd from institutional fantasy about the genius
        engineer I was able to find a gentle, efficent path to innovate.

        Realness is a social network that doesn't take adbantage of human vanity.
        Realness is social media re-imagined as a tool rather then a popularity
