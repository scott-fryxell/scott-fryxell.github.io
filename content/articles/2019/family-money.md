An abundance of resources does not guarantee the best solution. I've seen this over and over again meeting development teams predominantly from family money and without any outsiders onboard. I see how this trend has has hindered tech's role in the arc of progress. It's like we've forgotten what the essential mix is and destroyed the original intent of disruption.

In the early days, tech was mostly male and mostly white. But we were also mostly social rejects from a diverse range of class. The people I shared rooms with were a hell of a lot more connected to the whole picture, so you couldn't roll in with a sheltered perspective. You would get checked.

Tech has bowed to advertisers. We commodified friendships and turned them into popularity contests, which looks a lot like something family money would do. This has not brought disruption to tech; it's financing an attention economy that focuses all eyes on wealth â€“ nothing new.

Be in the real world. If you can't, bring in people from the real world. See or listen to how it's fucked then do whatever you can to work it out. Do it because that is what you want.

We have a nasty habit of telling sheltered people they should lead (Be a rich kid, do whatever you want! Here have all this money, disrupt!). Teams have become so weighted in family money that the term disruption has mutated into, "What do my friends need?" and this way of thinking becomes less useful the farther our worlds are apart.

Every team needs someone who can bring its purpose back to earth; otherwise you are flying your organization blind.



[Every time I hear some tech genius talk about how he got his first computer when he was seven and was writing basic apps by eight I want to scream family money and charge at him with a spike. It's ugly who you've become and no one but your mom is proud of you.]
