## Commodifying relationships is unhealthy

We believe that knowing our customers relationships is too great a power for any business to have.

To this end we have built an application architecture focusing on knowing as little as possible about our customers. This is counter to every other social network that we know of.

We leave it to you and your device to know what your relationships are. We believe this aligns our values with yours.

Realness has no idea about your relationships. We know who you are individually, what each of you post, but have no idea who your friends are on the network.


## Trust but verify
We believe all healthy relationships support a trust but verify foundation. You can read and hopefully understand the code that we have written so that you can verify what we are saying is real. Realness is out in the open. It's a foundational element of how we want to work and live in this world.

I want to focus on our unique view of relationships. It's too great a power


Realness is designed to function without advertising. We don't believe that people should be able to pay to get access to the time you are socializing.

Realness is designed to be fast. It uses vector graphics for this, but also because there is a guarantee that images are new works of art. We have decided on a resolution when converting your pictures into posters that should communicate your meaning without giving opening the entire community to offensive content.

Realness is a serious attempt at recreating community online. It's an attempt to start afresh carrying forward some lessons we have all learned.

I invite you to join us, as we re-align ourselves with the stars and try this one more time.


## Pyramiding it

My plan is to build realness for moderators. Rather than run the network I want to write the code that enables natural community moderators to do their thing online.

This is another design feature. Fucking up should cost you some of your social network. but it should never rob you of your entire social network.

I imagine that people have 4 or 5 realness icons saved to their  phone one for each of the social networks that they are a part of in real life. Maybe they get drunk and say some shit and lose half their friends. They should lose about half of their social network then.

It should never be in one organizations hands all of the people you get to know. Everyone is gonna get drunk and say some stupid shit, let's build the mechanism for handling fucking up into the design of the network.

so, content on the phone. no way to know relationships, Moderators are first class citizens because the social network is distributed across them.

most of the high  bandwidth content sharing is intended to happen over text. Phone numbers are the ideal way for us to talk to each other. Realness bakes this in as much as it can.

Since there is no email address we are hoping it's a fuck load harder for robots to join the network en mass.
