pin-prick

Testing correctly slows you down. It slows you down so much that Scientists spend entire careers focusing and validating and peer reviewing and questioning tiny silos around small questions just to open up a pin prick of light on reality.

We can't be that disciplined in all things — too many epics reduce your accuracy, but we should be disciplined in a few; if only to find out how much work it takes to know for certain any one thing.

It's humbling.

An epic is a machine learning thing where they run the same data through repeatedly, improving the accuracy of the machine.

I learned from my new machine learning guy on Thursday that too many runs through and the epics accuracy starts to drop.

Thats true for real shit too.
