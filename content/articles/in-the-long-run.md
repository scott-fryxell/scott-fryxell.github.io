I'm beginning my 3rd month on a project, we are at the end of the MVP period. We used tailwind to get us here. It looked great from the beginning. But now I've come back to the UI for some tightening things up and tailwind's true colors are coming through.

I am lost in this html. There is duplication everywhere. I can't look at it and understand intuitively what is happening. The transition tag is a nightmare. All of this design mixed into all of this application makes it clumsy and ham-fisted to reason about when your re-reading it.

The design and the document structure are munged together making working with either one difficult. I can't get to the level of detail that would make working with either a reasonable experience. You know, it's coarse grained and like vague steering on a car.

Changing the layout is gonna take hours. If this were a CSS based project I could do it quickly. Tailwind UI's are quick to write but you're gonna hate working with it in the long term.
