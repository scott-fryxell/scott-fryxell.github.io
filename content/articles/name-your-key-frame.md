Let's say you are building an animation and you can describe the objects inside each keyframe. Your focused on a landscape. Those hills would come to life with a pattern.

It would be fun if you can name a pattern [houses-on-hills] and — though it doesn't yet exist, save it to your keyframe. Realness can turn the description into a challenge that people on realness can help realize.

Another idea — Let's say you've got a song you've recorded and you wanna match it to keyframes. A quick and dirty way to make this work is to have the song length determine the tempo. then keyframes will sync with the audio naturally
