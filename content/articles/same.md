I don't use the nytimes app, though I pay for a subscription I do not accept advertising into my life. I think its wrong to let wealthy have a shot at manipulating me. I trust the nytimes journalistic standards but not their advertising.

I don't push this shit on my kid. but I did make a social media app for us to share so she knows what I mean. It's the best way I knew how to guarantee she'd understand. That's it. I don't preach. Okay, I try. So there politics over.

The only way I can enforce my beliefs on the nytimes (and Washington post, WSJ, youtube, and amazon prime) is to use the web. I know this is a minority position. And I know I have no recourse against Applications that are compiled into native apps and hosted by Apple.

I will pay extra to maintain my dominance over companies that think advertising is a legitimate revenue stream. Fuck you guys. Rich people telling poor people to ignore what benefits them is gross to me.

The web protects me and because it's text out in the open I can live my personal morality directly. I don't have to ask permission — I can enforce.

This change apple has made to PWAs in Europe has laid clear that my personal beliefs are not a priority. I'll need to compile and submit, to live in their ecosystem; where apps are free to manipulate me. advertise at me.

You're not the only Unix in town buddy.

I have been loyal to Apple since my first purchase, a classic II, to use with opcode studio vision, it was a requirement for the music class about computer music I was taking at Diablo Valley College in Pleasant Hill. I've been buying and using apple products since. This change means I am no longer welcome in their ecosystem. And you shouldn't feel welcome either.

The choice is stark but clear – No more apple hardware, no more wealthy paternalism telling me they are here to keep me safe. I accept that apple has only made me safe for others to manipulate. I left instagram, facebook, twitter, never even considered tiktok or snapshot. I will not be your victim.

I get to pick what I goes into my eyes. PWA is the only guarantee I could find that can cut the mustard. You don't get to point and be scared about it.

You don't support me mother fucker I don't support you.
