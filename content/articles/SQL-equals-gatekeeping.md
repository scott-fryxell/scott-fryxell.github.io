I'm stoked for this project. I would work with this team on anything. They are smart and diligent and know the job. But SQL forced a dynamic that doesn't exist with firebase. somethimg that feels akin to getting a faster processor, firebase frees developer from gatekeeping bottlenecks.

SQL does not play well with 'as written' text. It forces normalization which means rules and conversations and since it's not document based every change can potentially crash the server and so experts are required. Then as a new senior guy you have to ask to get what you need to make progress. This feels like molasis to work through.

I've got twenty three years of experience building web apps and within a week of joining with the Laravel team I had my layout and security code replaced from under me. One of the changes was so Ill tested that it introduced a performance ruining bug and make the code look totally unstable.

It happened with security too. A SQL team will assume everyone else is ignorant in order to keep its data secure. It HAS too. None of this exists in firebase, you work without ever crashing a server, or asking for a change that takes a day or two to implemented.You can be three senior guys peer programing.

I let them make all the changes they wanted. I let them invoke vue 2 development patterns on a vue 3 project. We gotta get his app built. and so hear it it is and i'm gonna circle back and have some discussions with the team about security in vue 3 and how you much you can do with the composition api.

But it'll just be suggestions that they can choose to listen to or ignore. It's even more aparent to me that SQL is the problem. that the problem is inherant to the tech. because this team is so sensitive and nice and willing to work hard. You couldn't pick better people to work with; it's just faster with firebase.

You can't beat a gatekeeper; not without tearing down the castle.
