I can't spell accessibility. I can't spell lot's of words. It's even harder for me to read `um. I am dyslexic. And I am learning as Software development matures into the twenty first century that most development teams have at least a few dyslexics, I wasn't diagnosed until I was in my thirties which is pretty normal.

As I'm reading through someone's code I first use the shape of the word to try and understand it. PascalCase robs me of reading shape first. 

We've been using spaces between words for ten thousand years. I don't understand why I should have to prove having a space between words is useful to the largest possible audience.

I don't know, We can talk about Accessibility, or we can practice it.
