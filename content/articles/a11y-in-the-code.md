I can't spell accessibility. I can't spell lot's of words. It's even harder for me to read `um. I am dyslexic. I am learning as Software development matures into the twenty first century that most development teams have at least a few dyslexics, I wasn't diagnosed until I was in my thirties which is pretty normal.

It's important to take time and think about variable naming. How can we include and optimize for the widest array of readers?

As I'm reading through someone's code I first use the shape of the word to try and understand it. And so I use snake_case and kabab-case for my names. camelCase is becoming all the rage as it improves editors ability to autocomplete and make inferences about code. VueJs is going hard in the paint for it. With 3.2 and the new `<script setup>` synctactic sugar. You have to PascalCase to get components auto included in your template.

Forced into this type of casing slows me down. I am robbed of my reading shape-first strategy.

We've been using spaces between words for ten thousand years. I don't understand why I have to [prove](https://v3.vuejs.org/style-guide/#self-closing-components-strongly-recommended) having a space between words is useful to the largest possible audience.

I don't know, we can talk about Accessibility - or we can practice Accessibility.
