I can't spell accessibility. I can't spell lot's of words. It's even harder for me to read `um. I am dyslexic. And I am learning as Software development matures into the twenty first century that most development teams have at least a few dyslexics, I wasn't diagnosed until I was in my thirties which is pretty normal.

As I'm reading through someone's code I first use the shape of the word to try and understand it. PascalCase robs me of this as I first have to grok the letter and then I can make out the shape.

I don't know, We can talk about Accessibility, or we can practice it.

PascalCase is becoming all the rage in the javascript community. I think PascalCase's adoption is being by Visual Studio Code. Microsoft is running a monopoly game â€“ look at all this functionality you get for free! All you gotta give up is your code's size and readability.

Google, Microsoft, and Amazon have deep cultures of word people. It's been years and they mostly don't support dark mode. I know how much I don't exist for them.
