Html is my database, it's so forgiving.

Because it isn't judging what you know about it.

Because it's permissive

"Just give me what you write" I'll make something out of it.


HTML is my database because you can take that clay and mold it into sculpture. You can make expressive, human experiences, that invite repetition and creative journeys.

HTML is my database because parsing it is fast. And you have access to an entire DOM's worth of API's that millions of people have been considering and improving for over 25 years.

HTML is my database because it is the beating heart of the free and open internet. It's text it's open. anyone can read what you are doing to them. It's right their they but need the curiosity.

HTML is my database because it's on the edge. It's easy to store and leave on the phone. HTML free's you to leave the data warehouses. You can pick what data lives on the server â€” You treat your customer like they are your equal. HTML creates a shared space for you to decide where your data lives.


HTML is my Database.
