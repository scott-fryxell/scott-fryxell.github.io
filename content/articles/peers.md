At its heart peer dynamics are about being curious with one another's work.  I want to know what you did, and why. I am curious about you. I struggle with this. I get emotional. I am prickly when peers make value judgments about my code.

I want to work with someone who is curious about why I did what I did. Why are you statically coding in the layout?

An MVP is all about the art of knowing what to build â€” and how to build it fast. It's about ignoring 3rd party utilities and coding simple solutions is the ideal path. I spent 2 months studying vue 3 and couldn't get these full-stack-devs to be curious about why I made the decisions I did.
