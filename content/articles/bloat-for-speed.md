Code is the mental model of your application. I write code so that you can load it into your brain. Concise statements written to be understood. A critical part of this [for me](/blog/a11y-in-the-code) is writing a little code as possible. Less code thats more legible so that you have an easy time loading it into your brain.

I have had extensive experience with typed languages. Everyone should type their code. almost no one should use typed languages. I went from Java to Ruby to escape code bloat.

Writing web applications has taught me to apreciate how the structure of things determine bow you understand it.

Procedural people love typed languages. But you can type without using a type system. Typescript will make you work for your tooling. I don't need the distractions. I type across component boundaries. Vue build runtime typing into application development.

Tailwind and typescript are examples of ignoring what you don't want to lear

code bloat and ignoring this concepts it says write a ton more code that's more difficult to read so that you can move faster and write more formally accurate code.

Any developer who ignores typescript is a junior developer who doesn't fully understand what typing is and why would you bring it to the table.
