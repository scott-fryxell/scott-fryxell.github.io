SQL has inherent gatekeeping and I'm stoked for this project. I would work with this team on anything. They are smart and diligent and know the job. But SQL forced a dynamic that isn't forced by firebase. Gatekeeping. When you have to ask to get what you need to make progress. SQL does not play well with 'as written' text. It forces normalization which means rules and conversations and since it's not document based every change can potentially crash the server and so experts are required. 

I've got twenty three years of experience building web apps and with in a week of joining with the Laravel team I had my layout and security code replaced from under me. One of the changes was so Ill tested that it introduced a performance ruining bug and make the code look totally unstable. 

They did again with security. A SQL team will assume everyone else is ignorant in order to keep its data secure. None of this exists in firebase, you work without ever crashing a server, or asking for a change that takes a day or two to get. 

I let them make all the changes they want. You can't beat a gatekeeper not without tearing down the castle.
