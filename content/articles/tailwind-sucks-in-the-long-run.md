tailwind-sucks-in-the-long-run

I'm 3 beginning my 3rd month on a project, at the end of the MVP period. We used tailwind to get us here. It looked great from the beginning. But now I've come back to the UI the being tightening things up and tailwind's true colors are coming through. I am lost in this html. There is duplication everywhere. I can't look at it and understand intuitively what is happening. The transition tag is a nightmare. All of this design mixed into all of this application makes it clumsy and ham-fisted to reason about when your re-reading it. It's like I'm stuck with a comic book when I'm trying to read the story. 

Just changing the layout is gonna take 6 hours. If this were a CSS based project I could do it in an hour. It's quick to write but you're gonna hate working with it long term. You have to give up readability to get it built fast.
