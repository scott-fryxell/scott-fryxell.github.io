permission to act different

I am struggling between two personality types that have given themselves the permission of certainty. The one in business and another from academia. But this permission is rampant. It feels like everyone assumes permission to lead. To let their personal myths about the kings rights to rein over their conquered people, to make the calls, Its your turn, you did the work to get it here. You are the faster lighter better. you get to decree.

I have to navigate these people. no excuses, mostly I let nature take its course, I play for time and non-react to behavior that sucks. It's why smart people keep their mouth shut. You're not helping the world confronting the loudmouth at the bar. 

It's fundamentally a civil rejection of peer dynamics. It's saying "yay yay yay, democracy, wave the flag, fuck everyone though, I know how the real world works". We're all experts. and should be treated as such. 

Academia is comfortable in service to the king. Tenure is inherited 80% of our professors come from a family with post-graduate work. Instituional inbreeding is in bloom. The college campus serves king culture. Elitism is always on the winning team. 

But my other dude, He's salt of the earth, my kinda person. Let's do this ourselves we'll hack it out. he has the same problem. he's definitly treating his current work as life defining. This is where he's gonna make his dent in the universe. And so he's walking around, doing his best tech genius impression. Carrying what the culture has defined as counter-culture. He get's to be the tech decider. and, it's just facinating how easily fantasy can take over a peer dynamic, and turn it into leader > follower. 

We don't have guardrails in place that protect me from losing my peer dynamic with either one of these mother fuckers. So I am patient, I let nature take its course, and I confront the fantasy as it's bully side rears into view. 

Im not that patient though. Maybe that's what I'm writing here to get to. If I'm gonna riot over being a peer I have to be good at looking for my part. I have to be able to balance these two personality types. I want to be good at channeling our dynamics towards being useful for each other. 

No excuses.

But peer dynamics are what we crave. I think about the dutch in the 1640's. I think about the founding fathers. I think about the fight to end slavery. I think about women's rights. Civil rights You're right to marry and fuck who you please. 

Both are liberals. Both are tolerant, but we on the left are still humping king worship around like it's on our team. We fiefdom, and make it righteous with the worst of um. 

It would turn either of these sons-a-bitches stomachs to know how often we are wrong, and how frequently we overreact.
