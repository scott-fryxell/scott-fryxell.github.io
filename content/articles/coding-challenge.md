It's a signup workflow for a consumer web app that uses Vue 2.X style options api, and is built with the Vue CLI. The code is production quality, tested and best practices, though not perfect.

Browse the problems on the issues tab on GitHub. Pick whichever question interests you and work on it until you are done learning and your code feels clean.

Issue a pull request. We will code review it together with you. You have access to the original author to ask questions before and as you work on it. We want this to be as close to a real world async-style development workflow as possible.

If none of issues are appealing give use some of your own code to review. A repo with history that exemplifies your coding style and philosophy.
