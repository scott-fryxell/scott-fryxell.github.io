America has a special responsibility to continually renew itself to be young to mix together and look to the oportunities in the future, Elitisim hunts all successfull culture, is a rotting from the inside, a shortcut for the already arrived. How you look saving the world is why you are trying to save the world. The children of rockstars are our only available rockstars.

Instead of lamenting the constant assault, we can view the mirror people as a symptom of a system that lacks verification; a system we are not checking the work of. We should be sending some of our kids off to sharpen their forearms and check a sheltered worlds work. Make these elitists earn it. Make them work.

It's the opportunity of the now, when our babies can come back home to us; We can live in our communities â€” a contributing member; while having to perform at a high level at work.

Come back to us children.
