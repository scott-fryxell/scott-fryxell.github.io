Elitist systems go sour. America has a special responsibility to continually renew to protect from a rotting elitism.

Too much looking in the mirror. We fuck up constantly because how you look saving the world is why you are trying to save the world.

Instead of lamenting it we need to view it as a system we are not checking the work of. Instead of shooting all of our kids to join the elitist ranks we should be sending some of them off to sharpen their forearms and check a mother fuckers work. Make these elitists earn it. Make them work.

It's the opportunity of the now, when our babies can come back home to us. Live in our communities â€” a contributing member; while having to perform at a high level at work.

Come back to us children, we don't have to beat the elites to honor ourselves. But it's on us to keep them out of the mirror.
