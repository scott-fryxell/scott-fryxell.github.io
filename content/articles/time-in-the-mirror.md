America has a special responsibility to continually renew itself, to mix together and look to the oportunities in the swirl. We are the world's experiment in regular folks getting along.

Elitisim hunts all successfull culture. It's a rotting from the inside. A culture creates excellence, elitisim celebrates it;  a shortcut for the already arrived. How you look saving the world is why you are trying to save the world. The children of rockstars are the only available rockstars. I don't feel wealthy.

Instead of lamenting the constant assault on excellence from the inside, we can view the mirror people as a symptom of a system that lacks verification; a system we are not checking the work of. We should be sending some of our kids off to sharpen their forearms through college and the corporate world not to become but to verify.

This, I think, is the opportunity of the now, We can live in our communities â€” a contributing member; while having to perform at a high level at work.

Come back to us children.
