# Apple home screen monopoly

The apple monopoly is that all web apps launched from the home screen launched Have to execute within a webkit context.

For developers trying to exist outside their walled garden the monopoly is remedied by allowing other rendering engines to launch the web app.

I don't want to live in your walled garden. I don't want to do business with monopoly interests. What is the remedy?
