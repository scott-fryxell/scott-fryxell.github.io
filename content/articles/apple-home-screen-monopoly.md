All web apps launched from the home screen have to execute within a webkit context.

For developers trying to exist outside walled gardens this is how apple controls access to the home screen. Where the apps live. To be a web app developer is not an easy thing.

I've read about how the EU is forcing apple to allow rendering engines other then webkit. My hope is that we can hold the line and secure an independent web app universe by demanding that each rendering engine has it's own access to the home screen.

For me, this is the only sure path to a fair marketplace.
