It's a plague upon science. Where you start from has a large effect on where you land making it difficult to prove patterns. What was the wind like when you threw the ball? You need to account for initial conditions when assessing things.

This is a hard pill to swallow when your initial conditions are fucked. But we all get the story. It's faith I know, I believe we all get the story, and we all get it in a custom order.

So how do you hire for talent and competency but make as much room as you can around intial conditions.

How do you censor your elitisim yet create high performing organizations. I don't know, though I have some intuitions.
