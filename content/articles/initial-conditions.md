It's a plague upon science. Where you start from has a large effect on where you land making it difficult to prove patterns. What was the wind like when you threw the ball? You need to account for initial conditions when assessing things.

A culture of royalty has a fear and a paranoia about initial conditions. They define everything.

Initial conditions decide our perspective. We are responsible for the effects of our opinions. Leaning on our initial conditions as a source of truth is a cognitive bias.
