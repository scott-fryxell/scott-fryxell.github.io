Firebase storage files are not stored or sent gzip'd. I'll need [to do it myself](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/transcoding). When done I reduce my file sizes by 60%. a 30k vector file will become 10k.

I am using a lot of intricate art as sample posters. some of these can get as big as 100k, which is okay as it's rare that posters create such detail. but gzipping make performance concerns disappear. 100k becomes 30k gziped. this will optimize Network performance â€“ This is some 30ms type shit. And it optimized realness in other ways, costs to run a realness instance are reduced by 60%, and the app is rocket fast (I don't have to store them gzipped on the edge).

A tool is fast.

Firebase is generous; In the three years I've used the service realness hasn't cost me a dime. They give developers the space to create. I already have a compression worker built to do the gziping on the edge.

If realness starts creeping toward costing money, I have this in my pocket ready to go. I got too much to build to do it now, but it's headroom. Performance is about knowing your headroom.
