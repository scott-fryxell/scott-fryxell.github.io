Firebase storage files are not stored or sent gzip'd. I'll need [to do it myself](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/transcoding). When done I reduce my file sizes by 60%. a 30k vector file will become 10k.

I am using a lot of intricate art as sample posters. Some vector files can get as big as 100kb, which is okay, as it's rare that posters are converted with such detail. Vector graphics are great at being compressed â€” gzipping posters will make performance concerns disappear. 100k becomes 30k gziped. This will optimize the Network performance, and costs to run a realness instance. The app is rocket fast. On the edge I can store them uncompressed and they'll render quickly.

A tool is fast.

Firebase is generous; In the three years I've used the service realness hasn't cost me a dime. They give developers the space to create. I already have a compression worker built to do the gziping on the edge, and convert to `${created_at}.html.gz`.

If realness starts creeping toward costing money, I have this in my pocket ready to go; it's headroom, something I can throw in there if the shit gets real. Performance is about knowing your headroom.
