I want the developer list to be using live data by the end of the weekend. I want to have the search and filter feature filtering the list of developers. That way Alex can start tweaking the UI with me until we get it right. That means merging the data I have into one CSV file that I import on app start and use while we work out the user experience.

I can have this in place by Monday.

So from the search interface all the users in one list that you paginate. And that you can filter. The list has a modal for each developer where you can view more info.

There is a way to connect that spends one credit per connection. App keeps track of what credits you are spending. And you subscibe from an account page where you also set the location and other criteria for what you are interested in.

It's not the features though, you are paying for a vetted list of interesting developers. You trust the screening because you have access to a daily coder whose code you see. It is their expertise that makes this worth the money. It's the filter that made the list. So B2B 100% Alex has the right focus and priorities.
