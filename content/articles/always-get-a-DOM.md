I can feel sql slowing me down. I spent 4 hours yesterday massaging 465 entries to get them to import into SQL. It's like 1983.

Because HTML is so permissive I don't have this problem. I always get a dom. I can always dig into what's going on.

Enterprise's love SQL. And profiting from your laziness. Facebook is SQL. Realness is HTML.

HTML is my database
