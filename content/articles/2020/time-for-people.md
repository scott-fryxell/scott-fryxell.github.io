Realness is far enough along now for beta users. I want to announce realness to technical people who can help me evaluate it's effectiveness.

What I need most at first are people to try out nerds.realness.online and see what they think. I have yet to set that url up.

is it a viable option for taking social networking away from the people who would.  manipulate us into beliebing

I'm gonna publish my journals from the last couple of years so there is some idea what this shit has been like to build.

First I gotta go through them and censor the names of any women I did perverted things to in my writing.

I just watched this documentary about [poverty in american](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHDkALRz5Rk) and am loosing my mind in hatred for all the wealth around me.

I'm gonna choke to death from all the teeth I'm missing. But I'm not really here you fucking assholes am I. You just see [each other](https://danwang.co/college-girardian-terror/).

I need help. But I'm enraged by the people who are in the best postion to help me. Who are you tech fuckers anymore, because I don't recognize anyone I can work with.

I feel alone
