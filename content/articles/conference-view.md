Got new marching order from Alex@VueSchool. We are building an app that helps people track and understand the ROI on conferences. 

A person can describe upcoming conferences that they are considering sponsoring what the dates of the conference are. When pre-requisites are due (media kits). Whether they have speaking slots and if the conference is single track or multi track. 

We want to track metrics about the conference, 
	- conference name
	- sponsorship level
	- sponsorship title
	- Attendies
	- cost
	- labor involved
	- change in signups, web traffic

We need a list view and a calendar view.
We would like a mobile version. Admins should be able to invite other users.

We want to build the application with firebase, use tailwind for the UI. 

I think the split view for a month inside the mobile calendars app is a great way to navigate. Swipe up and down on the month to quickly navigate through your upcoming conferences.

# Tuesday, November 30th

It's 4am and here we are. 

I have persistence in place, tailwind in place, Continious integration, a publicly accessible website, I've got listing and prettier. The dev environment works for vscode and atom (I assume this means it will work well for the jetbrains IDE)

I have icons sorted out, but need media from VueSchool

I need a square app Icon that is at least 512px squared. 
I need a color scheme, and icons, and I need logo, and wordmark.

What's left is 
- [PWA](https://rubenr.dev/en/pwa-vite/)
- testing 
- a mobile deploy workflow for the App Store. 

This is great. By the end of today. I would like a crud app with minimal design, that you can add a conference event too. 

I would like to store it to me Home Screen and use it like a native app for the next month or however long it takes to figure out what this app is going to work like. 

We've got a tight little development cycle here que'd up and ready for feedback from all interested parties.
