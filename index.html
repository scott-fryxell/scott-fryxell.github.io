      <h1>Realness</h1><p>Its just, I hate it when rich kids win and everyone just assumes they know better.</p>
<p>It&#39;s been my experience that rich kids are as narrow minded and average as the rest of us. They are fallible. They guess and use their resources to paper over any mistakes that bubble to the surface. Depth is not natural for them.</p>
<p>Basically, what I&#39;m saying is – <strong>They don&#39;t know how to help.</strong></p>
<p>I walked away from startup land in 2015. I could not handle how fake people had become. I felt abandoned and disconnected. I no longer believed in technology as a force for good. So I spent a couple years in the reject bin. I couldn&#39;t do it, I couldn&#39;t pretend the march of bullshit through my industry was healthy. The tech gold rush had won. All I saw around me was greed and artificial caring. It wasn&#39;t worth it anymore.</p>
<p>The people that did care had been conned by the Harvard kids into using their talent for Mark&#39;s &#39;vision&#39; of a connected world. There was nothing to do but get off the ride.</p>
<p>Then we got the president fakery deserves. A man who could only win in a social media landscape that advantaged him.</p>
<p>His whole point was that everyone is a liar, all the rich kids in charge were fake too, selfish too, in it for themselves. You might as well hire an honest fake to call bullshit. Looking at my industry I couldn&#39;t say that he was wrong.</p>
<p>That pissed me off, and so I got to work. <a href="https://realness.online">Realness</a> is what I came up with.</p>
<h3>What you can do with realness</h3><ul>
<li>You can post updates</li>
<li>You can sign up with your phone</li>
<li>You can take a selfie and create an avatar</li>
<li>You can look for people you may know on realness</li>
<li>You can add those people  </li>
<li>You can view a feed of what those people want to say</li>
</ul>
<p>There are no likes. There are no friend counts, There are no comments. You text your friends directly when they post something that moves you.</p>
<h3>What I know about realness from using it</h3><ul>
<li>I post a lot less</li>
<li>What I do post is genuine</li>
<li>I check it a lot less</li>
<li>I text when I relate to what&#39;s in my feed</li>
<li>I feel connected</li>
</ul>
<p>Realness is a social network that&#39;s more like a tool than a popularity contest. It uses your phone number, so you get messaging, group text built in.  All of your information stays on your phone. I don&#39;t even know who your friends are. What is shared on the network are your posts and a simple profile for people to find you.</p>
<p>Go to <a href="https://realness.online">realness.online</a> on your phone to use it, and <a href="https://patreon.com/scottfryxell">patreon.com/scottfryxell</a> to give it a helping hand</p>
<h1>Real talk</h1><p>The other social networks are designed to manipulate users into maximum engagement. They take manipulation as gospel. Their logic is as follows: We are a business that makes money from advertising. Advertising is manipulation. We&#39;re just doing what our users accept is happening.</p>
<p>Thats how you justify yourself into a nice home and a sick Audi.</p>
<p>This is not the internet that I signed up for. What I saw back in the 90&#39;s were people that wanted to build an internet for everyone. I hate to say it now, but I believed in that internet.</p>
<p>We wanted to make knowledge available so that everyone could feel what it&#39;s like to live an intellectually engaged life. That future seemed thrilling to me – a poor kid, with nowhere to go.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t have that world today do we? Even though the best and the brightest have had a generation and a half to figure it out. They just went for that advertising money, and told us all our music was worth 0.086 pennies a listen. They are doing the same thing their parents did – hoarding all the opportunity for themselves; shrinking the pie so that they can get a bigger slice.  </p>
<p>I don&#39;t want my social network to use my desire for connection against me.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t want be socially engineered. I don&#39;t want to become a walking resume. I don&#39;t want a social network overflowing with anxiety where the most dramatic people have the loudest voices.</p>
<p>I want a social network to tell everyone that I am okay, That I need time alone, but I love them and that our time together buoys me.</p>
<p>I want to use my social network to know where to be and when to be there. I want genuine feelings being shared between people that I know. And I want them to feel that even when we are alone we can be together.</p>
