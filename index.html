<p>I've been scaling up my work with Cursor's AI in the last three months. More than line completion, I am using it to help me work through and implement solutions; trying to push what I can get done.</p>
<p>It has been going well. I feel like I am two and sometimes three developers and the code I am writing has higher standards and is willing to go deeper.</p>
<p>I have upgraded to a fairly intense set of <a href="https://github.com/realness-online/web/blob/main/eslint.config.js" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">linting</a> rules; have type visibility via <a href="https://github.com/realness-online/web/blob/main/tsconfig.json" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">JSDoc</a>. I even brought my test harness back online. Nothing's perfect, all three are works in progress but I feel like these are ideal setups for where cursor shines as an assistant. I can learn about how to type for clarity, get inference errors sorted quickly; fix linting mismatches and even repair and create tests that build my confidence.</p>
<p>I have more useful tools without paying extraordinary costs in harness maintenance. I am finding the sweet spot. It is amazing that the busy work is less of a headwind now. That I have a best practices machine at the ready has me going harder. And not being slowed down by testing feels like I've got a buddy back.</p>
<p>But my confidence to trust the work I'm doing with AI is not blind. I know to harden myself for the future. I learned how to survive in vim this last year, It's going to be my low assistance editor. To keep my ability to support the nerd handshake, I have <a href="https://github.com/scott-fryxell/kata-machine" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">forked</a> into a deno version the Primeagen's kata machine.</p>
<p>This is the dream, right: we are stronger for AI, More capable; rewarded for pushing ourselves.</p>
<h2 id="the-interview-problem"><a href="#the-interview-problem" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>The Interview Problem</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.404media.co/anthropic-claude-job-application-ai-assistants/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Finding out</a> that Anthropic is asking developers to not use AI during the interview process is pretty bonkers. I think it shows that we've always half-assed our way into finding good engineers.</p>
<p>This morning I fixed a bug with syncing anonymous posters and statements when a user signs into the application. I got a solution that kinda worked with Cursor's (and Claude's) help. Then I went for a walk and without being in front of a computer found myself fixing the bugs I knew the solution I had just implemented created. I had the application and its intricacies in my head and was able to walk through my solution and find additional bugs.</p>
<p>This gets at the heart of what we should be hiring for – the ability to put a problem in your head and then play with it like a living, functioning system. We're stuck interviewing for memorization and intense recall when we should be looking for systems imagination.</p>
<p>When we give interviewees problems during an interview, we're not giving them time to load the model into their brains and then show you how it works for them. Their goals are to game your system hoping to be lucky enough to have studied the exact problem you're giving them to solve.</p>

<p>Only in the beginning of your firestore app can you store the document ID inside the document. If references get out of sync, you'll barely notice yourself driving into the wall.</p>
<p>These are the kinds of worries I have swimming around in my head.</p>
<h2 id="i-hypocrite"><a href="#i-hypocrite" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>I, Hypocrite</h2>
<p>When working in Firestore you want to build your app around the document id as the one source of truth. the change above reinforces document id as king. Using data converters frees me to have easy access in code to id while never duplicating it inside the schema. Now we are doing what we can in our app to enable fast development and intuitive developer experience while maintaining data integrity.</p>
<p>But with Realness this approach would prove to be unstable, because of how different the databases purpose are.</p>
<p>Since Realness is an HTML database build to be device centric we want the <code>itemid</code> attribute to be the source of truth the rest of the application relies on. The poster's file name can and will change based on the context. On the network it's saved as <code>/author/type/created-at</code> which is optimized for feeds.</p>
<p>When you download the poster the name is ornate <code>Scott Fryxell, Thursday, February 6 at 1_31 PM.svg</code>, as rococo as I can go with a file name.</p>
<p>by keeping the source of truth inside the html I can query it's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Microdata" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Microdata</a> and build an object model magically. It comes alive on device and keeps my promise to the user that the server is  inert.</p>
<p>I can live in both of these worlds I can load them both into my imagination and compare contrast and analyze how they perform against their purpose.</p>

<p>It shouldn't matter that the developer is using AI. What matters is how good you can ride the bicycle of your mind.</p>
<p>I want to hire and work with people that have active imaginations, are tidy, and can hang out with queers and meat-heads in equal measure, who want a friend group filled with some motherfuckers who are on fetlife and others who go to church.

I think two articles in juxtaposition make my point. One from Sam Altman the other an opinion piece for the NYTimes by Isabella Glassman.
Opposing views emanating out of the center of elitism. What's it gonna be? Our education system is preparing our children to enter a winner-take-all monopoly fight against each other to dominate our futures.</p>

<p>Civilization is the first AI, a sentiment I agree with.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sam Altman: We are more capable not because of genetic change, but because we benefit from the infrastructure of society being way smarter and more capable than any one of us; in an important sense, society itself is a form of advanced intelligence. Our grandparents – and the generations that came before them – built and achieved great things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each of us burdens under six thousand years of not being good enough for the gods.</p>
<blockquote>
<p> Isabella Glassman: It’s called pre-professional pressure: a prevailing culture that convinces many of us that only careers in fields such as computer programming, finance and consulting, preferably at blue-chip firms like Goldman Sachs, McKinsey or big tech companies, can secure us worthwhile futures.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the gods are only going to make room for a special chosen few.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Isabella Glassman: Last year, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/goldman-internship-just-got-harder-summer-analyst-acceptance-rate-2024" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">315,126 undergraduates</a> applied for the 2,700 available undergraduate intern positions at Goldman Sachs. Beyond the right major, the not-so-secret formula for the perfect résumé demands participation in a relevant extracurricular activity, which explains the competitive process at some selective schools to join pre-professional clubs.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>False scarcity has our college students running scared. And the ones that win are gonna feel entitled to all the cake. Think of all the people they beat out.  They can't have happy lives unless they out compete each other.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Isabella Glassman: It sounds silly — in hindsight, it was — but that is how I felt when I was surrounded by thousands of intelligent classmates competing for the same handful of results. I’d wake up at 3:30 a.m. from the recurring nightmare that I didn’t land an internship my junior year summer. I heard people, maybe friends, endlessly discussing the “only way” to be successful. I consoled a sobbing roommate after she failed to land the job her parents expected her to get.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is manufactured scarcity. These kids are often from affluent families with security. and yet they are acting like they won't be able to survive. That they will be judged as failures unless they strive and glass face everyone in perpetual excitement and motivation.</p>
<p>Each of them is forced into faking it, striving, proving their value or die judged as unworthy. Service never enters the equation (unless it pads the resume). Any of these kids who get into Wharton are going to feel absolutely entitled to all the cake. They worked so hard beating the rest of us at going to college they'll know, be absolutely certain, they deserve it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Isabella Glassman: Naturally, when thousands of students rush into the same handful of majors and professions, supply cannot possibly meet demand. That’s particularly true now, as openings for postgraduate tech industry jobs <a href="https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/computer-science-majors-job-market-7ad443bf" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">advertised</a> on the student job board Handshake decreased about 30 percent this spring from the prior year. <a href="https://www.retailbankerinternational.com/analysis/inflation-market-turbulence-contributing-to-decline-in-finance-jobs/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Job openings in the financial sector</a> are similarly declining. <a href="https://www.reveliolabs.com/news/business/the-view-from-30k-feet-tough-times-ahead-for-consulting/#:~:text=First%2C%20we%20find%20that%20despite,dates%20for%20undergraduates%20and%20MBAs." rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Consulting firms</a> have cut numbers of new hires and delayed start dates for undergraduates with offers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Desperation abounds among our most privileged children. They can't sleep, they are depressed and doom scrolling like desperate starving children.  They know the opportunities are drying up; How will They survive as the robots steal everything they've earned ?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sam Altman: AI models will soon serve as autonomous personal assistants who carry out specific tasks on our behalf like coordinating medical care on your behalf. At some point further down the road, AI systems are going to get so good that they help us make better next-generation systems and make scientific progress across the board.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How to square this with a college system build on ever more elitist rings of scarcity, A system that pits kids with wealthy parents in a desperate struggle for survival against each other.</p>
<p>Those of us who strive outside the elitist system are thrown away before we even get in the room. Innovation subsumes to desperate monopoly. Picking the right friends matters.</p>
<p>They have food. shelter, belonging, and are at the beginning of a lifetime of opportunity and yet are acting like they will all be homeless unless admitted into the right clubs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Isabella Glassman: Unfortunately, I knew my state government internship was a scarlet letter of inadequacy. My classmates seemed to think the world comprised investment bankers, management consultants — and everyone else.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How is AI gonna change any of this? It's just another tool to enable a bunch of desperate kids to run as hard as they can at the wall. How can elitism spare the time to see anyone else.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sam Altman: As we have seen with other technologies, there will also be downsides, and we need to start working now to maximize AI’s benefits while minimizing its harms. As one example, we expect that this technology can cause a significant change in labor markets (good and bad) in the coming years, but most jobs will change more slowly than most people think,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can use AI right now as another boogey man to light fires of desperation under the asses of our over achievers. Who don't even see me or you as viable humans. Especially once they find out what colleges we didn't get into.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sam Altman – Stanford graduate: I believe the future is going to be so bright that no one can do it justice by trying to write about it now; a defining characteristic of the Intelligence Age will be massive prosperity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Right.  This is the part where elitists slow down and notice the rest of us.</p>

It's okay, because it's up to your family to teach you what's healthy and not advertisings job to keep us on the golden path. Lets normalize consumption and checking out and rely on traditional family structures and private schools (even better if they are boarding schools), and well educated parents to help us with what's right and what's true.</p>

<p>I don't use the NYtimes app; though I pay for a subscription. I do not accept advertising into my life. I think its wrong to let wealthy people have a shot at manipulating me. I trust the nytimes journalistic standards but not their advertising.</p>
<p>I don't push this shit on my kid. but I did make a social media app for us to share so she knows what I mean. It's the best way I knew how to guarantee she'd understand. That's it.</p>
<p>The only way I can enforce my beliefs on the nytimes (and Washington post, WSJ, youtube, and amazon prime) is to use the web. I know this is a minority position. And I know I have no recourse against Applications that are compiled into native apps and hosted by Apple. In Apples world they can get at me all they want.</p>
<p>I will pay extra to maintain my dominance over companies that think advertising is a legitimate revenue stream. Fuck you guys. Rich people telling poor people to ignore what benefits them is <a href="/blog/burning-through-our-daughters">gross</a> to me.</p>
<p>The web protects me and because it's text out in the open I can live my personal morality directly. I don't have to ask permission — I can enforce.</p>
<p>This change Apple has made to PWAs in Europe has laid clear that my personal beliefs are not a priority. I'll need to compile and submit to live in their ecosystem; where apps are free to manipulate me; advertise at me.</p>
<p>You're not the only Unix in town buddy.</p>
<p>I have been loyal to Apple since my first purchase, a classic II, to use with Opcode's Studio Vision, it was a requirement for the class about computer music I was taking at Diablo Valley College in Pleasant Hill. I fell in love with Opcode. It was heaven with my Korg M1. A personal universe opened up before me. A place all my own. I could make something here; all broken on my own.</p>
<p>When OSX came out I was heavy into Emacs; working at Covalent and surrounded by Unix masters. I had a mac running Apple's Unix within a week of it's release. Damn the torpedos. Its that the input boxes worked with Emacs key bindings, that I could navigate natively just like I do when I code, a subtle attention to detail; an artistic promise to do excellence. I was in reliable hands; Apple was gonna do Unix right.</p>
<p>Droping PWA support in Europe means I am no longer welcome in Apple's ecosystem. That the web is a privelage. And you and I over here in 'merica had better be good boys or we're next.</p>
<p>The choice is stark but clear – No more apple hardware, no more wealthy paternalism telling me they are here to keep me safe. I accept that apple has only made me safe for others to manipulate. I left instagram, facebook, twitter, never even considered tiktok or snapshot. I will not be your victim.</p>
<p>I get to pick what goes into my eyes. PWA is the only guarantee I could find that can cut the mustard for the standards I want to live by. You don't get to point and be scared about it. You don't support me mother fucker I don't support you. Fair enough.</p>
<p>Who I do support is Europe. They are the noble warrior in this fight. They should go hard here. They should force Apple to suppot PWA cause it's PWA support or make a third party the arbiter of what spec shit Apple has to implement. Apple is turning an EU mandate into an excuse to grab more control.</p>
<p>No mercy.</p>

<p>I am using a lot of intricate art as sample posters. Some vector files can get as big as 100kb, which is okay, as it's rare that posters are converted with such detail. Vector graphics are great at being compressed — gzipping posters will make performance concerns disappear. 100k becomes 30k gziped. This will optimize the Network performance, and costs to run a realness instance. The app is rocket fast. On the edge I can store them uncompressed and they'll render quickly.</p>

<p>Firebase is generous; In the three years I've used the service realness hasn't cost me a dime. They give developers the space to create. I already have a compression worker built to do the gziping on the edge, and convert to <code>${created_at}.html.gz</code>.</p>

<p>I have used HTML for some Pinia duties for years. the current state of any object is the html that is being rendered. If I need new state I load the object from the local database and render it. It's instant.</p>
<p>I use The DOM to manage mutations. What the person is viewing is what the components are sharing. The data is right there. Nothing is out of sync from the user.</p>
<p>The state can be shared accross components via <code>load</code> and <code>list</code> methods I have keyed to microdata's <code>itemid</code>x attribute itemid=/${userid}/posters/${created_at}. Most of the time this works great. But ocassionally I need changes I'm making to spread out accross each component instantly rather than waiting for <code>load</code> and <code>list</code> to be called. This is where Vue 3's composables have come in handy.</p>
<p>In Realness, Relations are who you are following. They are referenced in like 15 modules. Each instance of relations only knows about itself and isn't aware of changes. I have to pass events for everything to coordinate.</p>

<p>Regular ass people need to feel safe and want to share some form of the public square. Regular ass people want to take responsibility for what is theirs. We realize that a democracy requires that we do this part ourselves.</p>
<p>A civil society needs more than the mall. To have a singular place run by one organization is to loose touch with an essence of a free society. We all know it.</p>
<p>Churches, Punks, and Veterans. I have loved you. I built a thing from what I have learned being with you. Let's take responsibility for ourselves.</p></div> <footer></footer></article><article class="post"><header><img src="/posters/Scott_Fryxell_posters_Wednesday, September 22, 4_24 PM.svg" loading="lazy"> <h2><a href="/blog/bloat-for-speed">bloat for speed</a></h2></header> <h5>April 12, 2022</h5> <div class="nuxt-content"><p>Code is the mental model of your application. I write code so that you can load it into your brain. Concise statements written to be understood. A critical part of this <a href="/blog/a11y-in-the-code">for me</a> is writing a little code as possible. Less code thats more legible so that you have an easy time loading it into your brain.</p>
<p>I have had extensive experience with typed languages. Everyone should type their code. almost no one should use typed languages. I went from Java to Ruby to escape code bloat.</p>
<p>Writing web applications has taught me to apreciate how the structure of things determine bow you understand it.</p>
<p>Procedural people love typed languages. But you can type without using a type system. Typescript will make you work for your tooling. I don't need the distractions. I type across component boundaries. Vue build runtime typing into application development.</p>
<p>Tailwind and typescript are examples of ignoring what you don't want to lear</p>
<p>code bloat and ignoring this concepts it says write a ton more code that's more difficult to read so that you can move faster and write more formally accurate code.</p>
<p>Any developer who ignores typescript is a junior developer who doesn't fully understand what typing is and why would you bring it to the table.</p></div> <footer></footer></article><article class="post"><header><img src="/posters/Scott_Fryxell_Wednesday, June 1, 9_47 AM.svg" loading="lazy"> <h2><a href="/blog/fast-for-everyone">fast for everyone</a></h2></header> <h5>April 10, 2022</h5> <div class="nuxt-content"><p>I've built out the posters that realness generate. It's what I envisage a poster to look like. It's created from a source image but has characteristics that take advantage of svg,</p>
<p>A poster is 4 layers. There is a background layer, a light layer, a regular layer and a bold layer — similar to how fonts work. Each layer has a gradient and potentially a filter associated with it.</p>
<p>This is the future, but the future is choking safari. SVG's are rendered by the CPU rather than the GPU. The code for SVG in webkit (what safari is built on) is 20 years old. There are fixes for moving svg to render on the GPU from the people at igalia. But when their code will be accepted by webkit and released is unkown.</p>
<p>It's got me thinking about how to degrade the performance of the graphics gracefully. if I could turn on and off features of SVG's based on the render time I should be able to degrade nicely into slow computers. but show the UI off on devices that can handle the cycles or browsers that offload SVG to the GPU.</p>
<p>This is the front row seat to Apple's monopoly — They control all rendering of web content on their phone,. and let safari die on the vine. Numb at the fingertips unable to feel the priority of fixing twenty year old performance bottlenecks. This low key drives developers into their ecosystem. Monopoly all the way.</p></div> <footer></footer></article><article class="post"><header><img src="/posters/Scott_Fryxell_posters_Friday, May 21, 3_27 PM.svg" loading="lazy"> <h2><a href="/blog/time-in-the-mirror">time in the mirror</a></h2></header> <h5>February 17, 2022</h5> <div class="nuxt-content"><p>America has a special responsibility to continually renew itself, to mix together and look to the oportunities in the swirl.

<p>I am lost in this html. There is duplication everywhere. I can't look at it and understand intuitively what is happening. The transition tag is a nightmare. All of this design mixed into all of this application makes it clumsy and ham-fisted to reason about when your re-reading it.</p>
<p>The design and the document structure are munged together making working with either one difficult. I can't get to the level of detail that would make working with either a reasonable experience. You know, it's coarse grained and like vague steering on a car.</p>
<p>Changing the layout is gonna take hours. If this were a CSS based project I could do it quickly.

<p>HTML is my database because parsing it is fast. And you have access to an entire DOM's worth of API's that millions of people have been considering and improving for over 25 years. HTML can be so permissive because it has all this experience.</p>
<p>HTML is my database because it is the beating heart of the free and open internet. It's text it's open. anyone can read what you are doing to them. It's right their they but need the curiosity.</p>
<p>HTML is my database because it's on the edge. It's easy to store and leave on the phone. HTML free's you to leave the data warehouses.

<p>I am finishing this conversion to Vue 3.2. I am comfortable with it now. I let my tests start to fail and knew my coverage was gonna drop. I will also let my tests fail from time to time.</p>
<p>VueSchool let me spend October and November learning Vue 3.2, and typescript, and Nuxt, and vuetify, and a whole host of other pieces of the vue ecosystem. Having gone hard and studied and focused on learning where we are as an industry, I am turning back towards My specific development goal – making realness posters fun. My immediate goal is How to color, style and animate the posters realness creates. I've got the social network part built. Converting pictures that you take into vector graphics with multiple layers that you can color and animate.</p>
<p>I use firebase storage as to store data in html files. I am happy with my stack.</p>
<p>Up to now I have used Microdata to describe my types - and a simple 100 line javascript file to parse them. Posters, Avatars, Events, Statements.</p>
<p>But animating and styling posters is complex. The data that cab exist on a single element is non trivial.</p>
<p>A path element along could contain 50 or so relevant attributes that I may want to style. I have this problem with svg animate elements too. With a ruleset and validations I don't want to duplicate.</p>
<p>With a simple one line change I am able to bind a complex element to my data model. It's any animation I can imagine - Run on the GPU. I have easy access to every Object in HTML CSS, and SVG.</p>
<p>I think of HTML as a first class citizen. I can describe any data type in HTML. Up to now I have satisfied using micro data for this purpose.</p>
<p>But SVG poses a unique problem. I want all of the attributes, validations, rulesets and privelages of a path element. I need to know everything about it. And I don't want to reproduce it myself.</p>
<div class="nuxt-content-highlight"><pre class="language-text line-numbers"><code>// from
case 'path':return element.outerHTML

// from
case 'path':return element

</code></pre></div>
<p>Microdata lets me set SVGPathElement directly. I was never constrained to string values. Item supports complex HTML types intuitively.</p>
<p>with change I get runtime <a href="https://www.motiontricks.com/creating-dynamic-svg-elements-with-javascript/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">typing</a> for any path elements <code>&lt;path itemprop="vector"/></code>.</p>
<p>Any time I want to type based on an html Element I can. I have sensible defaults and configurable complexity.</p>
<p>What I love about this is I have easy access to all of CSS's animation effects. Which I can trust to be accelerated on the GPU.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>browsers, you can use CSS for attributes like cx, cy, r etc. When SVG2 is released, it will have geometry properties (cx, cy, r, rx, ry etc.). I’m not going to dive too deep into upcoming features. You can read more about that at your leisure.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This has convinced me that HTML is database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to spend my performance budget wisely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can build Realness AND build a service that serves validated transforms in HTML</p>

<p>A secondary</p>
<p>How am I going to animate these vector graphics in a way that I can make downloadable? I have landed on using CSS's animation tools first but haven't yet figured out how to incorporate the named animation into the downloaded vector.</p>
<p>You can make and attach your own custom comoponents to and attach then manipulate them as types during your runtime.</p>
<p>This is better typing than Even if you need to extract your data to a database I would argue that this is a more natural way to write webapps. It's a natureal friend of serverless edge and data sanctity.</p></div> <footer></footer></article><article class="post"><header><img src="/posters/Scott_Fryxell_posters_Thursday, July 8, 1_38 PM.svg" alt="16th Street Bart station.

I can’t spell a lot of words. As a dyslexic, it's even harder for me to read them. I was diagnosed in my late thirties, well into my career as a software developer. Dyslexia––commonly defined as a brain-based learning disability that specifically impairs a person’s ability to read despite having normal intelligence––affects up to 20 percent of the population and is the most common of all neuro-cognitive disorders. As software development matures into the twenty-first century, most software companies will have us on their teams.</p>
<p>We can talk about accessibility, or we can practice accessibility. How do we include and optimize for the widest array of readers? Take a moment to consider variable naming.</p>
<p>As I read through a line of code, my brain only processes the shape of the whole word to begin to understand it. It is a spacial understanding, rather than linear. PascalCase is becoming all the rage as it improves editors’ ability to autocomplete and make inferences about code. VueJs is going all in on PascelCase and the new <code>&lt;script setup></code> syntactic sugar. You have to use PascalCase to get components auto-included in your template. But for my own purposes and for the accessibility of others like me, I use snake_case and kabab-case for my naming.</p>
<p>Forced into other types of casing slows me down. I am robbed of my shape-first reading strategy.</p>
<p>We've been using spaces between words for ten thousand years. And it’s been less than a century since dyslexia has been widely understood. I don't understand why I have to <a href="https://v3.vuejs.org/style-guide/#self-closing-components-strongly-recommended" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">prove</a> having a space between words makes programming accessible to the largest possible audience.</p></div> <footer></footer></article></section> <footer></footer></main></div></div><script defer src="/_nuxt/static/1739575747/state.js"></script><script src="/_nuxt/b8e2696.js" defer></script><script src="/_nuxt/ad28538.js" defer></script><script src="/_nuxt/a763c74.js" defer></script><script src="/_nuxt/ff8de8a.js" defer></script><script src="/_nuxt/0890946.js" defer></script>
