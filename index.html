Testing asks a lot of you. Testing isn't into freebies or rewards. But I do it. I see what it brings to the table. For three years I tested religiously. But in February I put my testing down and am focused on releasing. I won't be brining testing back, not until I'm out in the open with realness. It's why everything feels easy to do now, effortless, Hyper complex interoperating moving parts harmonizing their efforts. That's what this code base feels like. Balanced.</p>
<p>That's what testing does. It's your muscles, and your harmony machine. but you turn it off when you gotta focus, pausing to make room for getting shit done. Sometimes you gotta kill your idols to see what they are.</p></div> <footer></footer></article><article class="post"><header><img src="/posters/Scott_Fryxell_Wednesday, June 1, 9_50 AM.svg" loading="lazy"> <h2><a href="/blog/performance-headroom">performance headroom</a></h2></header> <h5>May 22, 2022</h5> <div class="nuxt-content"><p>Firebase storage files are not stored or sent gzip'd. I'll need <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/transcoding" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">to do it myself</a>. When done I reduce my file sizes by 60%. a 30k vector file will become 10k.</p>
<p>I am using a lot of intricate art as sample posters. Some vector files can get as big as 100kb, which is okay, as it's rare that posters are converted with such detail. Vector graphics are great at being compressed — gzipping posters will make performance concerns disappear. 100k becomes 30k gziped. This will optimize the Network performance, and costs to run a realness instance. The app is rocket fast. On the edge I can store them uncompressed and they'll render quickly.</p>
<p>A tool is fast.</p>
<p>Firebase is generous; In the three years I've used the service realness hasn't cost me a dime. They give developers the space to create. I already have a compression worker built to do the gziping on the edge, and convert to <code>${created_at}.html.gz</code>.</p>
<p>If realness starts creeping toward costing money, I have this in my pocket ready to go; it's headroom, something I can throw in there if the shit gets real. Performance is about knowing your headroom.</p></div> <footer></footer></article><article class="post"><header><img src="/posters/Scott_Fryxell_Wednesday, June 1, 9_48 AM.svg" loading="lazy"> <h2><a href="/blog/HTML-is-my-state-machine">HTML is my state machine</a></h2></header> <h5>May 18, 2022</h5> <div class="nuxt-content"><p>Edge poses weird quandries when you start taking advantage of how close your code and data are.</p>
<p>I have used HTML for some Pinia duties for years. the current state of any object is the html that is being rendered. If I need new state I load the object from the local database and render it. It's instant.</p>
<p>I use The DOM to manage mutations. What the person is viewing is what the components are sharing. The data is right there. Nothing is out of sync from the user.</p>
<p>The state can be shared accross components via <code>load</code> and <code>list</code> methods I have keyed to microdata's <code>itemid</code>x attribute <code>itemid=/${userid}/posters/${crated_at}</code>. Most of the time this works great. But ocassionally I need changes I'm making to spread out accross each component instantly rather than waiting for <code>load</code> and <code>list</code> to be called. This is where Vue 3's composables have come in handy.</p>
<p>In Realness, Relations are who you are following. They are referenced in like 15 modules. Each instance of relations only knows about itself and isn't aware of changes. I have to pass events for everything to coordinate.</p>
<p>This has created some spaghetti code that I spent yesterday cleaning up with <a href="https://vueschool.io/articles/vuejs-tutorials/home-rolled-store-with-the-vue-js-composition-api/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">module level reference</a> variables defined inside composable files eg <code>@/use/people</code>. State changes can be shared accross all modules instantly bringing feature parity with Pinia.</p></div> <footer></footer></article><article class="post"><header><img src="/posters/Scott_Fryxell_Monday, May 23, 6_29 AM.svg" loading="lazy"> <h2><a href="/blog/who-is-the-judge">who is the judge</a></h2></header> <h5>April 27, 2022</h5> <div class="nuxt-content"><p>My problem with hiring is one of hubris. You are not qualified to know who is the right hire for a job is. Almost no one has the skill to spend an hour in a sterile office with a random person and know if they are gonna be a great fit. SQL people can't tell you if a front end developer is a serious talent. They can only tell you if a front end person knows SQL.</p>
<p>How can we hire when we know we are not qualified? I like the right person for the right job perspective. Is this person qualified to do the job I need done now?</p>
<p>Using contractors and freelancers. lets you 'hire' for the job you need done and keeps the talent pool free'd up. It's good to let people move on to something else when the job they want to do is complete.</p>
<p>This is the Netflix's view. Hire a team, and hire for position. If the work is done, let the person go with the warmest regards — mindful to build a world that is fair for them long term.</p>
<p><a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/03/03/stop-aggregating-away-the-signal-in-your-data/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">related to using sql kills your data</a>. I like the signal metaphor. keep their writing as much as possible. every true or false is a signal degradation. That's why I have version control on. I can see my data through time on realness. how people come in and go.</p>

He was in a union his whole career. Marines are cynical. They don't believe you. They've all seen a sharply dressed man fall over a sharply dressed cliff. He wouldn't pay for garbage because my dad knew they were lying about what it costs.

<p>Peers are egalitarian. They believe in each other enough to know they have to do it together. That's one of my special sauces on a development team.

A critical part of this <a href="/blog/a11y-in-the-code">for me</a> is writing a little code as possible. Less code thats more legible so that you have an easy time loading it into your brain.</p>
<p>I have had extensive experience with typed languages. Everyone should type their code. almost no one should use typed languages. I went from Java to Ruby to escape code bloat.</p>
<p>Writing web applications has taught me to apreciate how the structure of things determine bow you understand it.</p>
<p>Procedural people love typed languages. But you can type without using a type system. Typescript will make you work for your tooling. I don't need the distractions. I type across component boundaries. Vue build runtime typing into application development.</p>
<p>Tailwind and typescript are examples of ignoring what you don't want to lear</p>
<p>code bloat and ignoring this concepts it says write a ton more code that's more difficult to read so that you can move faster and write more formally accurate code.</p>
<p>Any developer who ignores typescript is a junior developer who doesn't fully understand what typing is and why would you bring it to the table.</p></div> <footer></footer></article><article class="post"><header><img src="/posters/Scott_Fryxell_Wednesday, June 1, 9_47 AM.svg" loading="lazy"> <h2><a href="/blog/fast-for-everyone">fast for everyone</a></h2></header> <h5>April 10, 2022</h5> <div class="nuxt-content"><p>I've built out the posters that realness generate. It's what I envisage a poster to look like. It's created from a source image but has characteristics that take advantage of svg,</p>
<p>A poster is 4 layers. There is a background layer, a light layer, a regular layer and a bold layer — similar to how fonts work. Each layer has a gradient and potentially a filter associated with it.</p>
<p>This is the future, but the future is choking safari. SVG's are rendered by the CPU rather than the GPU. The code for SVG in webkit (what safari is built on) is 20 years old. There are fixes for moving svg to render on the GPU from the people at igalia. But when their code will be accepted by webkit and released is unkown.</p>
<p>It's got me thinking about how to degrade the performance of the graphics gracefully. if I could turn on and off features of SVG's based on the render time I should be able to degrade nicely into slow computers. but show the UI off on devices that can handle the cycles or browsers that offload SVG to the GPU.</p>
<p>This is the front row seat to Apple's monopoly — They control all rendering of web content on their phone,. and let safari die on the vine. Numb at the fingertips unable to feel the priority of fixing twenty year old performance bottlenecks. This low key drives developers into their ecosystem. Monopoly all the way.</p></div> <footer></footer></article><article class="post"><header><img src="/posters/Scott_Fryxell_posters_Friday, May 21, 3_27 PM.svg" loading="lazy"> <h2><a href="/blog/time-in-the-mirror">time in the mirror</a></h2></header> <h5>February 17, 2022</h5> <div class="nuxt-content"><p>America has a special responsibility to continually renew itself, to mix together and look to the oportunities in the swirl.

<p>I am lost in this html. There is duplication everywhere. I can't look at it and understand intuitively what is happening. The transition tag is a nightmare. All of this design mixed into all of this application makes it clumsy and ham-fisted to reason about when your re-reading it.</p>
<p>The design and the document structure are munged together making working with either one difficult. I can't get to the level of detail that would make working with either a reasonable experience. You know, it's coarse grained and like vague steering on a car.</p>

I would work with this team on anything. They are smart and diligent and know the job. But SQL forced a dynamic that doesn't exist with firebase. somethimg that feels akin to getting a faster processor, firebase frees developer from gatekeeping bottlenecks.</p>
<p>SQL does not play well with 'as written' text. It forces normalization which means rules and conversations and since it's not document based every change can potentially crash the server and so experts are required. Then as a new senior guy you have to ask to get what you need to make progress. This feels like molasis to work through.</p>
<p>I've got twenty three years of experience building web apps and within a week of joining with the Laravel team I had my layout and security code replaced from under me. One of the changes was so Ill tested that it introduced a performance ruining bug and make the code look totally unstable.</p>
<p>It happened with security too. A SQL team will assume everyone else is ignorant in order to keep its data secure. It HAS too. None of this exists in firebase, you work without ever crashing a server, or asking for a change that takes a day or two to implemented.You can be three senior guys peer programing.</p>
<p>I let them make all the changes they wanted. I let them invoke vue 2 development patterns on a vue 3 project. We gotta get his app built. and so hear it it is and i'm gonna circle back and have some discussions with the team about security in vue 3 and how you much you can do with the composition api.</p>
<p>But it'll just be suggestions that they can choose to listen to or ignore. It's even more aparent to me that SQL is the problem. that the problem is inherant to the tech. because this team is so sensitive and nice and willing to work hard. You couldn't pick better people to work with; it's just faster with firebase.</p>

<p>I am finishing this conversion to Vue 3.2. I am comfortable with it now. I let my tests start to fail and knew my coverage was gonna drop. I will also let my tests fail from time to time.</p>
<p>VueSchool let me spend October and November learning Vue 3.2, and typescript, and Nuxt, and vuetify, and a whole host of other pieces of the vue ecosystem. Having gone hard and studied and focused on learning where we are as an industry, I am turning back towards My specific development goal – making realness posters fun. My immediate goal is How to color, style and animate the posters realness creates. I've got the social network part built. Converting pictures that you take into vector graphics with multiple layers that you can color and animate.</p>
<p>I use firebase storage as to store data in html files. I am happy with my stack.</p>
<p>Up to now I have used Microdata to describe my types - and a simple 100 line javascript file to parse them. Posters, Avatars, Events, Statements.</p>
<p>But animating and styling posters is complex. The data that cab exist on a single element is non trivial.</p>
<p>A path element along could contain 50 or so relevant attributes that I may want to style. I have this problem with svg animate elements too. With a ruleset and validations I don't want to duplicate.</p>
<p>With a simple one line change I am able to bind a complex element to my data model. It's any animation I can imagine - Run on the GPU. I have easy access to every Object in HTML CSS, and SVG.</p>
<p>I think of HTML as a first class citizen. I can describe any data type in HTML. Up to now I have satisfied using micro data for this purpose.</p>
<p>But SVG poses a unique problem. I want all of the attributes, validations, rulesets and privelages of a path element. I need to know everything about it. And I don't want to reproduce it myself.</p>
<div class="nuxt-content-highlight"><pre class="language-text line-numbers"><code>// from
case 'path':return element.outerHTML

// from
case 'path':return element

</code></pre></div>
<p>Microdata lets me set SVGPathElement directly. I was never constrained to string values. Item supports complex HTML types intuitively.</p>
<p>with change I get runtime <a href="https://www.motiontricks.com/creating-dynamic-svg-elements-with-javascript/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">typing</a> for any path elements <code>&lt;path itemprop="vector"/></code>.</p>
<p>Any time I want to type based on an html Element I can. I have sensible defaults and configurable complexity.</p>
<p>What I love about this is I have easy access to all of CSS's animation effects. Which I can trust to be accelerated on the GPU.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>browsers, you can use CSS for attributes like cx, cy, r etc. When SVG2 is released, it will have geometry properties (cx, cy, r, rx, ry etc.). I’m not going to dive too deep into upcoming features. You can read more about that at your leisure.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This has convinced me that HTML is database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to spend my performance budget wisely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can build Realness AND build a service that serves validated transforms in HTML</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/path" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">event setting d via style</a> which is crazy and amazing to me</p>

</ul>
<p>A secondary</p>
<p>How am I going to animate these vector graphics in a way that I can make downloadable? I have landed on using CSS's animation tools first but haven't yet figured out how to incorporate the named animation into the downloaded vector.</p>
<p>You can make and attach your own custom comoponents to and attach then manipulate them as types during your runtime.</p>
<p>This is better typing than Even if you need to extract your data to a database I would argue that this is a more natural way to write webapps. It's a natureal friend of serverless edge and data sanctity.</p></div> <footer></footer></article><article class="post"><header><img src="/posters/Scott_Fryxell_posters_Thursday, July 8, 1_38 PM.svg" alt="16th Street Bart station.

I can’t spell a lot of words. As a dyslexic, it's even harder for me to read them. I was diagnosed in my late thirties, well into my career as a software developer. Dyslexia––commonly defined as a brain-based learning disability that specifically impairs a person’s ability to read despite having normal intelligence––affects up to 20 percent of the population and is the most common of all neuro-cognitive disorders. As software development matures into the twenty-first century, most software companies will have us on their teams.</p>
<p>We can talk about accessibility, or we can practice accessibility. How do we include and optimize for the widest array of readers? Take a moment to consider variable naming.</p>
<p>As I read through a line of code, my brain only processes the shape of the whole word to begin to understand it. It is a spacial understanding, rather than linear. PascalCase is becoming all the rage as it improves editors’ ability to autocomplete and make inferences about code. VueJs is going all in on PascelCase and the new <code>&lt;script setup></code> syntactic sugar. You have to use PascalCase to get components auto-included in your template. But for my own purposes and for the accessibility of others like me, I use snake_case and kabab-case for my naming.</p>
<p>Forced into other types of casing slows me down. I am robbed of my shape-first reading strategy.</p>
<p>We've been using spaces between words for ten thousand years. And it’s been less than a century since dyslexia has been widely understood.
