<p>I am lost in this html. There is duplication everywhere. I can't look at it and understand intuitively what is happening. The transition tag is a nightmare. All of this design mixed into all of this application makes it clumsy and ham-fisted to reason about when your re-reading it. It's like I'm stuck with a comic book when I'm trying to read the story.</p>
<p>The design and the tree are munged together making working with either one difficult. I can't get to the level of detail with other that would make working with it easy. You know, it's coarse grained and like vague stearing on a car.</p>
<p>Just changing the layout is gonna take 6 hours. If this were a CSS based project I could do it in an hour. It's quick to write but you're gonna hate working with it long term. You have to give up readability to get it built fast.</p></div> <footer></footer></article><article class="post"><header><img src="/bart-in-july.svg" alt="16th Street Bart station.

<p>Let's say you are building an animation and you can describe the objects inside each keyframe. Your focused on a landscape. Those hills would come to life with a pattern.</p>
<p>It would be fun if you can name a pattern [houses-on-hills] and — though it doesn't yet exist, save it to your keyframe. The app will turn it into a challenge other users of realness can help realize.</p>

<p>Let's say you've got a song you've recorded and you wanna match it to keyframes. A quick and dirty way to male this work is to have the song length determine the tempo. You can sync some keyframes to parts of the audio.</p></div> <footer></footer></article><article class="post"><header><!----> <h1><a href="/blog/html-is-my-database">html is my database</a></h1></header> <details><summary>Last updated: February 6, 2022</summary> <nav></nav></details> <div class="nuxt-content"><p>Html is my database, it's so forgiving.</p>

<p>HTML is my database because you can take that clay and mold it into sculpture. You can make expressive, human experiences, that invite repetition and creative journeys.</p>
<p>HTML is my database because parsing it is fast. And you have access to an entire DOM's worth of API's that millions of people have been considering and improving for over 25 years.</p>
<p>HTML is my database because it is the beating heart of the free and open internet. It's text it's open. anyone can read what you are doing to them. It's right their they but need the curiosity.</p>
<p>HTML is my database because it's on the edge. It's easy to store and leave on the phone. HTML free's you to leave the data warehouses. You can pick what data lives on the server — You treat your customer like they are your equal. HTML creates a shared space for you to decide where your data lives.</p>

<p>I can't spell accessibility. I can't spell lot's of words. It's even harder for me to read `um. I am dyslexic. I am learning as Software development matures into the twenty first century that most development teams have at least a few dyslexics, I wasn't diagnosed until I was in my thirties which is pretty normal.</p>
<p>It's important to take time and think about variable naming. How can we include and optimize for the widest array of readers?</p>
<p>As I'm reading through someone's code I first use the shape of the word to try and understand it. And so I use snake_case and kabab-case for my names. camelCase is becoming all the rage as it improves editors ability to autocomplete and make inferences about code. VueJs is going hard in the paint for it. With 3.2 and the new <code>&lt;script setup></code> synctactic sugar. You have to PascalCase to get components auto included in your template.</p>
<p>Forced into this type of casing slows me down. I am robbed of my reading shape-first strategy.</p>
<p>We've been using spaces between words for ten thousand years. I don't understand why I have to <a href="https://v3.vuejs.org/style-guide/#self-closing-components-strongly-recommended" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">prove</a> having a space between words is useful to the largest possible audience.</p>
<p>I don't know, we can talk about Accessibility - or we can practice Accessibility.</p></div> <footer></footer></article><article class="post"><header><!----> <h1><a href="/blog/VueSchool-hiring">VueSchool hiring</a></h1></header> <details><summary>Last updated: February 6, 2022</summary> <nav></nav></details> <div class="nuxt-content"><h1 id="week-1-20th-to-26th"><a aria-hidden="true" href="#week-1-20th-to-26th" tabindex="-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a>Week 1 (20th to 26th)</h1>

<p>I want the developer list to be using live data by the end of the weekend. I want to have the search and filter feature filtering the list of developers. That way Alex can start tweaking the UI with me until we get it right. That means merging the data I have into one CSV file that I import on app start and use while we work out the user experience.</p>
<p>I can have this in place by Monday.</p>
<p>So from the search interface all the users in one list that you paginate. And that you can filter. The list has a modal for each developer where you can view more info.</p>
<p>There is a way to connect that spends one credit per connection. App keeps track of what credits you are spending. And you subscibe from an account page where you also set the location and other criteria for what you are interested in.</p>
<p>It's not the features though, you are paying for a vetted list of interesting developers. You trust the screening because you have access to a daily coder whose code you see. It is their expertise that makes this worth the money. It's the filter that made the list. So B2B 100% Alex has the right focus and priorities.</p></div> <footer></footer></article><article class="post"><header><!----> <h1><a href="/blog/SQL.equals.gatekeeping">SQL.equals.gatekeeping</a></h1></header> <details><summary>Last updated: February 6, 2022</summary> <nav></nav></details> <div class="nuxt-content"><p>SQL has inherent gatekeeping and I'm stoked for this project. I would work with this team on anything. They are smart and diligent and know the job. But SQL forced a dynamic that isn't forced by firebase. Gatekeeping. When you have to ask to get what you need to make progress. SQL does not play well with 'as written' text. It forces normalization which means rules and conversations and since it's not document based every change can potentially crash the server and so experts are required.</p>
<p>I've got twenty three years of experience building web apps and with in a week of joining with the Laravel team I had my layout and security code replaced from under me. One of the changes was so Ill tested that it introduced a performance ruining bug and make the code look totally unstable.</p>
<p>They did again with security. A SQL team will assume everyone else is ignorant in order to keep its data secure. None of this exists in firebase, you work without ever crashing a server, or asking for a change that takes a day or two to get.</p>
<p>I let them make all the changes they want. You can't beat a gatekeeper not without tearing down the castle.</p></div> <footer></footer></article><article class="post"><header><!----> <h1><a href="/blog/DOM-the-ORM">DOM the ORM</a></h1></header> <details><summary>Last updated: February 6, 2022</summary> <nav></nav></details> <div class="nuxt-content"><p>I am not above using a hack.</p>
<p>I am finishing this conversion to Vue 3.2. I am comfortable with it now. I let my tests start to fail and knew my coverage was gonna drop. I will also let my tests fail from time to time.</p>
<p>VueSchool let me spend October and November learning Vue 3.2, and typescript, and Nuxt, and vuetify, and a whole host of other pieces of the vue ecosystem. Having gone hard and studied and focused on learning where we are as an industry, I am turning back towards My specific development goal – making realness posters fun. My immediate goal is How to color, style and animate the posters realness creates. I've got the social network part built. Converting pictures that you take into vector graphics with multiple layers that you can color and animate.</p>
<p>I use firebase storage as to store data in html files. I am happy with my stack.</p>
<p>Up to now I have used Microdata to describe my types - and a simple 100 line javascript file to parse them. Posters, Avatars, Events, Statements.</p>
<p>But animating and styling posters is complex. The data that cab exist on a single element is non trivial.</p>
<p>A path element along could contain 50 or so relevant attributes that I may want to style. I have this problem with svg animate elements too. With a ruleset and validations I don't want to duplicate.</p>
<p>With a simple one line change I am able to bind a complex element to my data model. It's any animation I can imagine - Run on the GPU. I have easy access to every Object in HTML CSS, and SVG.</p>
<p>I think of HTML as a first class citizen. I can describe any data type in HTML. Up to now I have satisfied using micro data for this purpose.</p>
<p>But SVG poses a unique problem. I want all of the attributes, validations, rulesets and privelages of a path element. I need to know everything about it. And I don't want to reproduce it myself.</p>
<div class="nuxt-content-highlight"><pre class="language-text line-numbers"><code>// from
case 'path':return element.outerHTML

// from
case 'path':return element

</code></pre></div>
<p>Microdata lets me set SVGPathElement directly. I was never constrained to string values. Item supports complex HTML types intuitively.</p>
<p>with change I get runtime <a href="https://www.motiontricks.com/creating-dynamic-svg-elements-with-javascript/" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">typing</a> for any path elements <code>&lt;path itemprop="vector"/></code>.</p>
<p>Any time I want to type based on an html Element I can. I have sensible defaults and configurable complexity.</p>
<p>What I love about this is I have easy access to all of CSS's animation effects. Which I can trust to be accelerated on the GPU.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>browsers, you can use CSS for attributes like cx, cy, r etc. When SVG2 is released, it will have geometry properties (cx, cy, r, rx, ry etc.). I’m not going to dive too deep into upcoming features. You can read more about that at your leisure.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This has convinced me that HTML is database.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to spend my performance budget wisely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I can build Realness AND build a service that serves validated transforms in HTML</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/path" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">event setting d via style</a> which is crazy and amazing to me</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A secondary</p>
<p>How am I going to animate these vector graphics in a way that I can make downloadable? I have landed on using CSS's animation tools first but haven't yet figured out how to incorporate the named animation into the downloaded vector.</p>
<hr>
<p>You can make and attach your own custom comoponents to and attach then manipulate them as types during your runtime.</p>
<p>This is better typing than Even if you need to extract your data to a database I would argue that this is a more natural way to write webapps. It's a natureal friend of serverless edge and data sanctity.</p></div> <footer></footer></article></section> <footer></footer></main></div></div><script defer src="/_nuxt/static/1644172714/state.js"></script><script src="/_nuxt/219fa5f.js" defer></script><script src="/_nuxt/744c01b.js" defer></script><script src="/_nuxt/2edf4ca.js" defer></script><script src="/_nuxt/6891fb9.js" defer></script><script src="/_nuxt/7615ecf.js" defer></script>
