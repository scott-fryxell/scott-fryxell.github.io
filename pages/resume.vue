        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>
          From idea to complex web application, I provide perspective, guidance,
          and software development services. I offer authenticity and a creative
          environment for the people that I work with to explore problems and
          make decisions. I like to focus on elegant solutions executed to the
          highest possible standards.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have mentored, hired and maintained long lasting teams with minimal
          resources. My soft skills are highly developed and I can connect
          closely with diverse purpose driven organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Self-motivated and fun to work with, I tend to facilitate an
          environment where we enjoy bringing our best selves to the table. I am
          driven by a desire to write quality code using best practices, and to
          help build a useful Internet.

          creators through those services and then providing oAuth
          authorizations that we would use as proof they created the content. We

          Facilitated the migration of a knowledge management portal application
          from ColdFusion to J2EE. Mentored 6 developers through this
          transition. Proposed the application architecture and development
          migration path from ColdFusion to java, which entailed porting an
          unwieldy, two-tiered web application, to a scalable, multi-tiered,
          fault-tolerant enterprise application. Designed a flexible, and
          scalable security system, which was applied at different levels of
          granularity throughout the application.

          Provided technical support to client engineers, prospective customers,
          and business partners. Performed onsite installations and integration
          of application. Introduced departmental reorganizations, and
          development processes such as use cases, functional specification,
          design meetings, code reviews, that greatly increased application
          stability, and the capacity to quickly add features to the
          application.

          Ported the beta of the product from a rigid, duplicative, asp.net
          application architecture to a multi-tiered, MVC based, Java
          application. Evaluated and implemented drivers for use with
          Microsoft’s SQL Server that resulted in a three fold increase in
          application scalability. Developed flexible personalization and robust
          security services which allowed other developers to focus on the
          specifics of application development.
