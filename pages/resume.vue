        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>
          From concept to fully-fledged web applications, I offer perspective, guidance, and software development services.

        </p>
        <p>
          I have successfully mentored, hired, and maintained long-lasting teams, even with minimal resources. My well-developed soft skills allow me to connect closely with diverse, purpose-driven organizations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Self-motivated and enjoyable to work with, I create an atmosphere where we bring our best selves to the table. I am driven by a commitment to writing quality code using best practices and contributing to a more useful and robust internet.

          I have taken a proof-of-concept app from inception to production using Vue, Google Cloud, Firebase, and Replicate. We implemented a queue capable of processing an infinite number of stories at scale, hosting over fifty models on Replicate. Jobs are triggered, and permissions states are synced using Firebase functions.

          The SEEQ app collects stories and utilizes machine learning to test hypotheses and validate assumptions. Without the right tools, this process can be time-consuming, expensive, and frustrating—leading to an abundance of information but few actionable insights. Identifying and addressing large unmet needs is crucial for driving new brands, products, and business growth.

          I designed and implemented a personalization and security mechanism that created a secure, configurable environment for children to experience the Internet. I developed a lightweight application for rating and retrieving acceptable content for children, with personalization features allowing parents to control the types of content delivered to their children.

          I developed and maintained Visual Basic applications for different departments within the firm. I designed and implemented an unattended Windows NT desktop installation, including the installation of 23 applications for 1,400 users firm-wide. I developed regression tests to ensure application stability and organized the firm's technical support efforts, noticeably decreasing the turnaround time for addressing user support issues.
