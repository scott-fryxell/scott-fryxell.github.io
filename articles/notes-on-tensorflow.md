I choose to go slow in the beginning and ponder each of the parts of machine learning. I like to go slow the first time i move through something new. 

don't get me wrong, I'm great at hitting the ground running, because I know when it's time to slowwww down and get the timing right.

I have at least 8 pages of hand written notes, and they are now my bible. I will utilize spaced repetition to sink a perceptron living in a deeply layered neural network. I will understand how to train a model with data and back-propagation that uses the loss function and learning rate to update the models weights. how you can run the same training through the model repeatedly in epic to improve but that over training can ruin your mode. 

I have learned that it's possible to run serious machine learning on device. This is still early days though. So you have to do a lot of figuring it out on your own.

D3.js makes it possible to display all of the data running through your model both when your training it and when you are using it to make predictions. Which I feel is the golden ticket.

How this model makes decision is between you and the model. The server never knows. This robot is your robot; dumb as he be.

I forsee object detection, improving midground image, and sentiment analysis as early priorities.
