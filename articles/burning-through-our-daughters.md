Why do I think advertising is gross. It's that they will enable the highest bidder to reinforce that's its okay to gamble. It's okay to keep scrolling, It's okay to to starve yourself for a fleeting sense of self control. It's okay, because it's up to your family to teach you what's healthy and not advertisings job to keep us on the golden path. Lets normalize consumption and checking out and rely on traditional family structures and private schools (even better if they are boarding schools), and well educated parents to help us with what's right and what's true.

The rest of us, with shit parents and half ass teachers, whose  loose social groups don't feel right preaching, are left to figure it out on our own. We've got to be junkies when it gets hard, find ourselves in debt and doom scrolling with credit cards we never needed that promised we'd feel like adults the second we got one.

Each of us must discover on our own that the mass of culture is lying to us to get us to buy. We never get a chance at the pie. Even when we get one we can't justify the abuse 'winning' requires. How can we do unto others the crimes done against us?

Right Mark, let's eat up some daughters, well use them as magnets for boys and culture and well burn through them confident that nice families will save the daughters that matter.

That's our universe, Yours and mine. Lets glad hand every wealthy whim; Empowering new religions of wealth and followers. And my identity trumps your poverty. The only family that matters is the wealthy ones. That's whats gross about advertising.
