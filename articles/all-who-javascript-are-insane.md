All who javascript are insane

It's all the petty things about typescript that leave me non plused. You have to eat the bullshit you don't care about. Before you can get to what the code does. 

Typed languages are harder to read. 

Choosing where you type is a readability super power.



I jumped from java to ruby because I believed the rails guys.

When they argued that typed languages are petty. 

Large organizations love them. meh. Why would I agree with how they code? Hows that help me? I want to understand what this fucking code does. I want to understand it first thing. I care about types when I'm reading your docs. I runtime validate wisely so that my code is more accessible. 

Typescript is some backend bullshit. Just like using SQL, ruby tore the ass out of java because it prioritized readability. 

I want my code to be simple clear and direct. I want runtime type checking. Which is why I use vue. It's the best parts of rails. to me vue as a framework speaks to all of the core principles that made working in ruby a dream. High quality code was the norm. You were never off the hook. 

Typing is a poor mans testing for large organizations with lots of second rate developers. Its claiming a shortcut as a super power. It finds small bugs. and lets you write poorly thought through code. It gives a false sence os quality and standards. and it makes what your trying to say harder to understand. 

Type at runtime because [you ain't gonna need typescript](link_to_ruby_opinions).
