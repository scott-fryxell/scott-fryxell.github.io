description: When will the training data become polluted

Up until now chatGPT has had pure human data to ingest.

I figure they are gonna update the model with new content every 6 months.

As this technique of reading the entire contents of the web to create an artificial intelligence progresses it's going to start ingesting AI created content.

This will cause the AI to resonate against itself.
