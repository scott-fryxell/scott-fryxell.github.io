        <h2 id="commodifying-relationships-is-unhealthy">Commodifying relationships is unhealthy</h2>
<p>We believe that knowing our customers relationships is too great a power for any business to have. </p>
<p>To this end we have built an application architecture focusing on knowing as little as possible about our customers. This is counter to every other social network that we know of. </p>
<p>We leave it to you and your device to know what your relationships are. We believe this aligns our values with yours. </p>
<p>Realness has no idea about your relationships. We know who you are individually, what each of you post, but have no idea who your friends are on the network.</p>
<h2 id="trust-but-verify">Trust but verify</h2>
<p>We believe all healthy relationships support a trust but verify foundation. You can read and hopefully understand the code that we have written so that you can verify what we are saying is real. Realness is out in the open. It&#39;s a foundational element of how we want to work and live in this world. </p>
<p>I want to focus on our unique view of relationships. It&#39;s too great a power</p>
<p>Realness is designed to function without advertising. We don&#39;t believe that people should be able to pay to get access to the time you are socializing. </p>
<p>Realness is designed to be fast. It uses vector graphics for this, but also because there is a guarantee that images are new works of art. We have decided on a resolution when converting your pictures into posters that should communicate your meaning without giving opening the entire community to offensive content. </p>
<p>Realness is a serious attempt at recreating community online. It&#39;s an attempt to start afresh carrying forward some lessons we have all learned. </p>
<p>I invite you to join us, as we re-align ourselves with the stars and try this one more time. </p>
<h2 id="pyramiding-it">Pyramiding it</h2>
<p>My plan is to build realness for moderators. Rather than run the network I want to write the code that enables natural community moderators to do their thing online. </p>
<p>This is another design feature. Fucking up should cost you some of your social network. but it should never rob you of your entire social network. </p>
<p>I imagine that people have 4 or 5 realness icons saved to their  phone one for each of the social networks that they are a part of in real life. Maybe they get drunk and say some shit and lose half their friends. They should lose about half of their social network then. </p>
<p>It should never be in one organizations hands all of the people you get to know. Everyone is gonna get drunk and say some stupid shit, let&#39;s build the mechanism for handling fucking up into the design of the network. </p>
<p>so, content on the phone. no way to know relationships, Moderators are first class citizens because the social network is distributed across them.</p>
<p>most of the high  bandwidth content sharing is intended to happen over text. Phone numbers are the ideal way for us to talk to each other. Realness bakes this in as much as it can. </p>
<p>Since there is no email address we are hoping it&#39;s a fuck load harder for robots to join the network en mass. </p>

        <p>I have a successful career in engineering, but I had to do more than homework to get here. </p>
<p>I have had to sit every day and work with the rage my dad put inside me. It&#39;s what I have to do to get to the good shit, the soft brain: willing, open, subtle.</p>
<p>Between twelve and sixteen the beatings were senseless. They were brutal before, but at least they were predictable. My dad was in a rage my whole childhood, but from twelve to sixteen it was something worse – a sickness.</p>
<p>The physical violence from my dad stopped when I got help from our bishop, a former tunnel rat in Vietnam, who let me stay at his house for three days. When he brought me back to my house he talked to my dad––who was a Marine in the late fifties early sixties––and it worked. </p>
<p>Seventeen and eighteen was verbal shit. The names that people who beat you get to use. Your nothingness in word form. </p>
<p>So much violence. </p>
<p>But I got to where family money gets most people in tech. I walked my own path. I took my brain seriously and I worked my ass off to get in the room with you. </p>
<p>And now that I&#39;m here, all I can see is the potential that people like me could be brining to this work. I can&#39;t leave them behind.</p>
<p>I raised a daughter. When she was young I knew that what I was taught wouldn&#39;t fly. That I couldn&#39;t do to her what was done to me. I knew I had to eat it. I knew that it was my job to pass on love and discipline; to raise a fearless child.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t you get it? Tech can&#39;t put someone who is like me in the loser box. We see shit you don&#39;t. </p>
<p>And social media is getting this so utterly wrong. It commodified intimacy. It made the artificial more important than the real. I had to learn the hard way the hard way that a lie that you believe is all you need as excuse to have anger. The artificial will be brutal; a numb world always is.</p>

        <p>An abundance of resources does not guarantee the best solution. I&#39;ve seen this over and over again meeting development teams predominantly from family money and without any outsiders onboard. I see how this trend has has hindered tech&#39;s role in the arc of progress. It&#39;s like we&#39;ve forgotten what the essential mix is and destroyed the original intent of disruption.</p>
<p>In the early days, tech was mostly male and mostly white. But we were also mostly social rejects from a diverse range of class. The people I shared rooms with were a hell of a lot more connected to the whole picture, so you couldn&#39;t roll in with a sheltered perspective. You would get checked. </p>
<p>Tech has bowed to advertisers. We commodified friendships and turned them into popularity contests, which looks a lot like something family money would do. This has not brought disruption to tech; it&#39;s financing an attention economy that focuses all eyes on wealth – nothing new. </p>
<p>Be in the real world. If you can&#39;t, bring in people from the real world. See or listen to how it&#39;s fucked then do whatever you can to work it out. Do it because that is what you want.</p>
<p>We have a nasty habit of telling sheltered people they should lead (Be a rich kid, do whatever you want! Here have all this money, disrupt!). Teams have become so weighted in family money that the term disruption has mutated into, &quot;What do my friends need?&quot; and this way of thinking becomes less useful the farther our worlds are apart.</p>
<p>Every team needs someone who can bring its purpose back to earth; otherwise you are flying your organization blind.</p>
<p>[Every time I hear some tech genius talk about how he got his first computer when he was seven and was writing basic apps by eight I want to scream family money and charge at him with a spike. It&#39;s ugly who you&#39;ve become and no one but your mom is proud of you.]</p>

          <h2><a href="posts/realness-technical-overview.html">Realness, a technical overview</a></h2>
          <time datetime="4-01-2019">4-01-2019</time>
        </header>
        <p>I publish my My <a href="/feed.html">feed</a> here so you can see what It&#39;s like and also keep track of what each release is. With this post I want to give a technical overview of how I&#39;m building realness.</p>
<p>Realness.online, is a local events-based social network. Realness lets you socialize without having to worry about the software manipulating your vanity. User information is stored on the device, saving only posts and a simple profile on the network. Secure by design, It is also serverless, responsive, and progressive. Realness is designed to be launched from the home screen and runs as fast as a native application. Realness has no revenue share obligations, also by design.</p>
<p>Data is described in semantic HTML and objects are brought into javascript via <a href="https://github.com/scott-fryxell/realness/blob/master/src/modules/Item.js">Item.js</a>. It is based on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/microdata/">microdata</a> format.</p>
<p>I use Item.js to populate VUE objects in the UI and <a href="https://github.com/scott-fryxell/realness/blob/master/src/modules/Storage.js">Storage.js</a> to save them to local storage. Item.js and Storage.js together are my answer to flux and Vuex. Javascript functions as a controller preserving MVC pattern. All Models are described in HTML.</p>
<p>Activity, Posts, Profile, Avatar, Relationships, Events, Posters have all been successfully modeled using Storage.js and Item.js and I haven&#39;t been experiencing the pain that most Single Page Apps experience as their applications grow more complex.</p>
<p>Realness doesn&#39;t store relationship information on the server, so a person&#39;s feed is created on the client. <a href="https://github.com/scott-fryxell/realness/blob/master/src/views/Feed.vue">Feed.js</a> makes heavy use of HTTP2 streams. I am able to pull potentially hundreds of files into the client as one query. It&#39;s an interesting algorithm that loads up to date profile and post information from a simple list of phone numbers. Feed is performant  (sorting the feed by date is currently averaging 5 milliseconds) and has plenty of headroom for optimization as the user base grows.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/scott-fryxell/realness/blob/master/src/style/typography.styl">Typography.styl</a> is the UI foundation for realness. It sets up a baseline look and feel that allows me to add UI elements and trust they will align in a consistent and natural way. Text is readable and flows well: there is heavy use of a <a href="https://github.com/scott-fryxell/realness/blob/master/src/style/mixins/between.styl">mixin</a> I wrote that uses the slope-intercept form to scale UI elements to the display size (font size, line length, form inputs, images, menus etc).</p>

        <p>The other social networks are designed to manipulate users into maximum engagement. They take manipulation as gospel. Their logic is as follows: We are a business that makes money from advertising. Advertising is manipulation. We&#39;re just doing what our users accept is happening.</p>
<p>That&#39;s how you justify yourself into a nice home and a sick Audi.</p>
<p>This is not the internet that I signed up for. What I saw back in the &#39;90s were people that wanted to build an internet for everyone. I hate to say it now, but I believed in that internet.</p>
<p>We wanted to make knowledge available so that everyone could feel what it&#39;s like to live an intellectually engaged life. That future seemed thrilling to me – a poor kid, with nowhere to go.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t have that world today, do we? Even though the best and the brightest have had a generation and a half to figure it out. They just went for that advertising money and told us our music was worth 0.086 pennies a listen.  – hoarding all the opportunity for themselves; shrinking the pie so that they can get a bigger slice.  </p>
<p>I don&#39;t want my social network to use my desire for connection against me.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t want to be socially engineered. I don&#39;t want to become a walking resume. I don&#39;t want a social network overflowing with anxiety where the most dramatic people have the loudest voices.</p>
<p>I want a social network to tell everyone that I am okay, That I need time alone, but I love them and that our time together buoys me.</p>
<p>I want to use my social network to know where to be and when to be there. I want genuine feelings being shared between people that I know. And I want them to feel that even when we are alone we can be together.</p>
