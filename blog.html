        <p>They beat me until I was sixteen. Thats until this this dude who was a lieutenant in the army in Vietnam, a tunnel rat, he stepped in. That was what it was gonna take. My dad was a Marine in the late fifties early sixties, and it worked. I can&#39;t think about that tunnel rat without wanting to cry in gratitude.</p>
<p>After I was twelve the beatings were senseless. They were brutal before, but at least they were predictable. My dad was in a rage my whole childhood, but from twelve to sixteen it was something worse – a sickness.</p>
<p>So much violence.</p>
<p>Seventeen and eighteen was mostly verbal shit. You know, the names that people who beat you get to use. Your nothingness in word form. Dug in so deep.</p>
<p>And I got to where you are family money. I walked my own path. took my brain seriously and worked my ass off to get in the room with you. I see the us in them family money. We can&#39;t leave them all behind.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t you get it? You can&#39;t put someone who is like this in the loser box. I see shit you don&#39;t, I worked, put in twenty years of therapy. Dug so deep.</p>
<p>I have to sit every day and work with the rage my dad put inside me. It&#39;s what I have to do to get to the good shit, the soft brain, willing, open, subtle.</p>
<p>I can come too engineering with a gentle mind, every day, rain or shine. I had to do more than homework to get here.</p>
<p>Being honest to myself because a lie becomes an excuse which is all the space anger needs. I had to learn that the hard way; how ugly it is to lie to ones self.</p>
<p>I can relate to people that make you uncomfortable. Social media is getting this so utterly wrong. You guys, you commodified intimacy. You made the artificial more important than the real. The artificial will be brutal; a numb world always is.</p>
<p>I raised a daughter. When she was young I knew it wouldn&#39;t fly. That I couldn&#39;t do to her what was done to me. I knew I had to eat it. I knew that it was my job to pass on love and discipline; to raise a fearless child.</p>
<p>I know how wrong you are when you allow yourself to be afraid of sketchy vibes.</p>

      <p>I keep running into these development teams without any outsiders onboard. And I can see how it&#39;s blinded us to our part in progress&#39;s arc. It&#39;s like we&#39;ve forgotten what the essential mix is and destroyed the original intent of disruption.</p>
<p>In the early days we were mostly male and mostly white. but we were also mostly social rejects. No one was fucking me because I was a programmer. The people I shared rooms with were a hell of a lot more connected to what it&#39;s like to be a reject, so you couldn&#39;t just roll in with your sheltered perspective. You would get checked. Today everyone is so fragile, afraid, offended and isolated. We did this for advertisers. We commodified friendships and turned them into popularity contests which looks a lot like something family money would do.</p>
<p>Family money is not bringing disruption to tech; it&#39;s financing an attention economy that focuses all eyes on wealth – we already had that. It&#39;s not be a rich kid do whatever you want! Here have all this money, disrupt!</p>
<p>It&#39;s be in the real world see how it&#39;s fucked then do whatever you can to work it out. Because that&#39;s what you want.</p>
<p>We have a nasty habit of telling the sheltered people they should lead. Teams have become so weighted in family money that the term disruption has mutated into &quot;What do my friends need?&quot; and it stops being useful the farther our worlds are apart.</p>
<p>Every time I hear some tech genius talk about how he got his first computer when he was seven and was writing Basic apps by eight I want to scream family money and charge at him with a spike. It&#39;s ugly who you&#39;ve become bro. Nobody is proud of you.</p>
<p>I live in the real world and I see it. The real worlds is selling my home for 3.3 million.</p>
<p>None of you knows disruption. You have all forgotten that anyone who can type can fight you.</p>
<p>You need someone in your universe who talks to you to like you just read otherwise – you are flying your organization blind.</p>

          <h2><a href="posts/realness-technical-overview.html">Realness, a technical overview</a></h2>
          <time datetime="4-01-2019">4-01-2019</time>
        </header>
        <p>I publish my My <a href="/feed.html">feed</a> here so you can see what It&#39;s like and also keep track of what each release is. With this post I want to give a technical overview of how I&#39;m building realness.</p>
<p>Realness.online, is a local events-based social network. Realness lets you socialize without having to worry about the software manipulating your vanity. User information is stored on the device, saving only posts and a simple profile on the network. Secure by design, It is also serverless, responsive, and progressive. Realness is designed to be launched from the home screen and runs as fast as a native application. Realness has no revenue share obligations, also by design.</p>
<p>Data is described in semantic HTML and objects are brought into javascript via <a href="https://github.com/scott-fryxell/realness/blob/master/src/modules/Item.js">Item.js</a>. It is based on the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/microdata/">microdata</a> format.</p>
<p>I use Item.js to populate VUE objects in the UI and <a href="https://github.com/scott-fryxell/realness/blob/master/src/modules/Storage.js">Storage.js</a> to save them to local storage. Item.js and Storage.js together are my answer to flux and Vuex. Javascript functions as a controller preserving MVC pattern. All Models are described in HTML.</p>
<p>Activity, Posts, Profile, Avatar, Relationships, Events, Posters have all been successfully modeled using Storage.js and Item.js and I haven&#39;t been experiencing the pain that most Single Page Apps experience as their applications grow more complex.</p>
<p>Realness doesn&#39;t store relationship information on the server, so a person&#39;s feed is created on the client. <a href="https://github.com/scott-fryxell/realness/blob/master/src/views/Feed.vue">Feed.js</a> makes heavy use of HTTP2 streams. I am able to pull potentially hundreds of files into the client as one query. It&#39;s an interesting algorithm that loads up to date profile and post information from a simple list of phone numbers. Feed is performant  (sorting the feed by date is currently averaging 5 milliseconds) and has plenty of headroom for optimization as the user base grows.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/scott-fryxell/realness/blob/master/src/style/typography.styl">Typography.styl</a> is the UI foundation for realness. It sets up a baseline look and feel that allows me to add UI elements and trust they will align in a consistent and natural way. Text is readable and flows well: there is heavy use of a <a href="https://github.com/scott-fryxell/realness/blob/master/src/style/mixins/between.styl">mixin</a> I wrote that uses the slope-intercept form to scale UI elements to the display size (font size, line length, form inputs, images, menus etc).</p>

      <p>The other social networks are designed to manipulate users into maximum engagement. They take manipulation as gospel. Their logic is as follows: We are a business that makes money from advertising. Advertising is manipulation. We&#39;re just doing what our users accept is happening.</p>
<p>That&#39;s how you justify yourself into a nice home and a sick Audi.</p>
<p>This is not the internet that I signed up for. What I saw back in the &#39;90s were people that wanted to build an internet for everyone. I hate to say it now, but I believed in that internet.</p>
<p>We wanted to make knowledge available so that everyone could feel what it&#39;s like to live an intellectually engaged life. That future seemed thrilling to me – a poor kid, with nowhere to go.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t have that world today, do we? Even though the best and the brightest have had a generation and a half to figure it out. They just went for that advertising money and told us our music was worth 0.086 pennies a listen.  – hoarding all the opportunity for themselves; shrinking the pie so that they can get a bigger slice.  </p>
<p>I don&#39;t want my social network to use my desire for connection against me.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t want to be socially engineered. I don&#39;t want to become a walking resume. I don&#39;t want a social network overflowing with anxiety where the most dramatic people have the loudest voices.</p>
<p>I want a social network to tell everyone that I am okay, That I need time alone, but I love them and that our time together buoys me.</p>
<p>I want to use my social network to know where to be and when to be there. I want genuine feelings being shared between people that I know. And I want them to feel that even when we are alone we can be together.</p>
