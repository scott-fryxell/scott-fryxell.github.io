      <p>I have a successful career in engineering, but I had to do more than homework to get here.</p>
<p>I have had to sit every day and work with the rage my dad put inside me. It&#39;s what I have to do to get to the good shit, the soft brain: willing, open, subtle.</p>
<p>Between twelve and sixteen the beatings were senseless. They were brutal before, but at least they were predictable. My dad was in a rage my whole childhood, but from twelve to sixteen it was something worse – a sickness.</p>
<p>The physical violence from my dad stopped when I got help from our bishop, a former tunnel rat in Vietnam, who let me stay at his house for three days. When he brought me back to my house he talked to my dad––who was a Marine in the late fifties early sixties––and it worked.</p>
<p>Seventeen and eighteen was verbal shit. The names that people who beat you get to use. Your nothingness in word form.</p>
<p>So much violence.</p>
<p>But I got to where family money gets most people in tech. I walked my own path. I took my brain seriously and I worked my ass off to get in the room with you.</p>
<p>And now that I&#39;m here, all I can see is the potential that people like me could be brining to this work. I can&#39;t leave them behind.</p>
<p>I raised a daughter. When she was young I knew that what I was taught wouldn&#39;t fly. That I couldn&#39;t do to her what was done to me. I knew I had to eat it. I knew that it was my job to pass on love and discipline; to raise a fearless child.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t you get it? Tech can&#39;t put someone who is like me in the loser box. We see shit you don&#39;t.</p>
<p>And social media is getting this so utterly wrong. It commodified intimacy. It made the artificial more important than the real. I had to learn the hard way the hard way that a lie that you believe is all you need as excuse to have anger. The artificial will be brutal; a numb world always is.</p>
