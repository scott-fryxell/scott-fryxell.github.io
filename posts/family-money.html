      <p>An abundance of resources does not guarantee the best solution. I&#39;ve seen this over and over again meeting development teams predominantly from family money and without any outsiders onboard. I see how this trend has has hindered tech&#39;s role in the arc of progress. It&#39;s like we&#39;ve forgotten what the essential mix is and destroyed the original intent of disruption.</p>
<p>In the early days, tech was mostly male and mostly white. But we were also mostly social rejects from a diverse range of class. The people I shared rooms with were a hell of a lot more connected to the whole picture, so you couldn&#39;t roll in with a sheltered perspective. You would get checked.</p>
<p>Tech has bowed to advertisers. We commodified friendships and turned them into popularity contests, which looks a lot like something family money would do. This has not brought disruption to tech; it&#39;s financing an attention economy that focuses all eyes on wealth â€“ nothing new.</p>
<p>Be in the real world. If you can&#39;t, bring in people from the real world. See or listen to how it&#39;s fucked then do whatever you can to work it out. Do it because that is what you want.</p>
<p>We have a nasty habit of telling sheltered people they should lead (Be a rich kid, do whatever you want! Here have all this money, disrupt!). Teams have become so weighted in family money that the term disruption has mutated into, &quot;What do my friends need?&quot; and this way of thinking becomes less useful the farther our worlds are apart.</p>
<p>Every team needs someone who can bring its purpose back to earth; otherwise you are flying your organization blind.</p>
<p>[Every time I hear some tech genius talk about how he got his first computer when he was seven and was writing basic apps by eight I want to scream family money and charge at him with a spike. It&#39;s ugly who you&#39;ve become and no one but your mom is proud of you.]</p>
