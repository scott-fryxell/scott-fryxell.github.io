      <p>I keep running into these development teams without any outsiders onboard. And I can see how it&#39;s blinded us to our part in progress&#39;s arc. It&#39;s like we&#39;ve forgotten what the essential mix is and destroyed the original intent of disruption.</p>
<p>In the early days we were mostly male and mostly white. but we were also mostly social rejects. No one was fucking me because I was a programmer. The people I shared rooms with were a hell of a lot more connected to what it&#39;s like to be a reject, so you couldn&#39;t just roll in with your sheltered perspective. You would get checked.</p>
<p>The internet today feels fragile, afraid, offended and isolated. We did this for advertisers. We commodified friendships and turned them into popularity contests. We are making the people we serve miserable so that we can have nicer things then them. It&#39;s simple and without a counter culture the tech community is gonna run away from obvious truths that it needs to face to be relevant.</p>
<p>How do we include the losers? How to we remove the judgment, and share the room so that we increase the quality of the products we are building for people. I am one of those losers; though incredibly technical I have almost no college culture. Homework is an insane concept. Study makes sense. Someone else assessing me is also super weird. but I love to test myself.</p>
<p>College culture is approval culture. Have you assessed me as worthy. Is it your job to asses like a school teacher everyone around you - you are suffering from college culture. It&#39;s rampant in tech. You&#39;ve pooled yourselves into uselessness.</p>
<p>The problem is that family money and college culture tend to be isolating worlds and therefore create people who are not very good judges. Do you really think all the innovation is coming from people who spent 28 years doing everything to get your approval?</p>
<p>I&#39;m just talking to you frankly man. Is this really the world you wanna cement into place. Is this the America you&#39;ve been dreaming of?</p>
<p>Family money is not bringing disruption to tech; it&#39;s financing an attention economy that focuses all eyes on wealth â€“ we already had that. It&#39;s not be a rich kid do whatever you want! Here have all this money, disrupt!</p>
<p>It&#39;s be in the real world see how it&#39;s fucked then do whatever you can to work it out. Because that&#39;s what you want.</p>
<p>We have a nasty habit of telling the sheltered people they should lead. Teams have become so weighted in family money that the term disruption has mutated into &quot;What do my friends need?&quot; and it stops being useful the farther our worlds are apart.</p>
<p>Every time I hear some tech genius talk about how he got his first computer when he was seven and was writing Basic apps by eight I want to scream family money and charge at him with a spike. It&#39;s ugly who you&#39;ve become bro. Nobody is proud of you.</p>
<p>I live in the real world and I see it. The real worlds is selling my home for 3.3 million. IT&#39;s a price onlyl family money could love.</p>
<p>None of you knows disruption. If we become the same kind of people as harvard east coasters then there is no longer anything special about silicon valley and the bay.</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t have someone in your universe who talks to you to like you just read then you are flying your organization blind.</p>
