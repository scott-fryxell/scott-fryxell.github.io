      <p>The other social networks are designed to manipulate users into maximum engagement. They take manipulation as gospel. Their logic is as follows: We are a business that makes money from advertising. Advertising is manipulation. We&#39;re just doing what our users accept is happening.</p>
<p>That&#39;s how you justify yourself into a nice home and a sick Audi.</p>
<p>This is not the internet that I signed up for. What I saw back in the &#39;90s were people that wanted to build an internet for everyone. I hate to say it now, but I believed in that internet.</p>
<p>We wanted to make knowledge available so that everyone could feel what it&#39;s like to live an intellectually engaged life. That future seemed thrilling to me – a poor kid, with nowhere to go.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t have that world today, do we? Even though the best and the brightest have had a generation and a half to figure it out. They just went for that advertising money and told us our music was worth 0.086 pennies a listen.  – hoarding all the opportunity for themselves; shrinking the pie so that they can get a bigger slice.  </p>
<p>I don&#39;t want my social network to use my desire for connection against me.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t want to be socially engineered. I don&#39;t want to become a walking resume. I don&#39;t want a social network overflowing with anxiety where the most dramatic people have the loudest voices.</p>
<p>I want a social network to tell everyone that I am okay, That I need time alone, but I love them and that our time together buoys me.</p>
<p>I want to use my social network to know where to be and when to be there. I want genuine feelings being shared between people that I know. And I want them to feel that even when we are alone we can be together.</p>
