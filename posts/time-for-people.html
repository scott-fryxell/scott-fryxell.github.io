      <p>Realness is far enough along now for beta users. I want to announce realness to technical people who can help me evaluate it&#39;s effectiveness.</p>
<p>What I need most at first are people to try out nerds.realness.online and see what they think. I have yet to set that url up.</p>
<p>is it a viable option for taking social networking away from the people who would.  manipulate us into beliebing</p>
<p>I&#39;m gonna publish my journals from the last couple of years so there is some idea what this shit has been like to build.</p>
<p>First I gotta go through them and censor the names of any women I did perverted things to in my writing.</p>
<p>I just watched this documentary about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JHDkALRz5Rk">poverty in american</a> and am loosing my mind in hatred for all the wealth around me.</p>
<p>I&#39;m gonna choke to death from all the teeth I&#39;m missing. But I&#39;m not really here you fucking assholes am I. You just see <a href="https://danwang.co/college-girardian-terror/">each other</a>.</p>
<p>I need help. But I&#39;m enraged by the people who are in the best postion to help me. Who are you tech fuckers anymore, because I don&#39;t recognize anyone I can work with.</p>
<p>I feel alone</p>
