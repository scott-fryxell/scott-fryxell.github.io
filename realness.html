      <h2 id="realness">Realness</h2>
<p>It&#39;s just, I hate it when rich kids win and everyone just assumes they know better.</p>
<p>It&#39;s been my experience that rich kids are as narrow minded and average as the rest of us. They are fallible. They guess and use their resources to paper over any mistakes that bubble to the surface. Depth is not natural for them.</p>
<p>Basically, what I&#39;m saying is â€“ <strong>They don&#39;t know how to help.</strong></p>
<p>I walked away from startup land in 2015. I could not handle how fake people had become. I felt abandoned and disconnected. I no longer believed in technology as a force for good. So I spent a couple of years in the reject bin. I couldn&#39;t do it, I couldn&#39;t pretend the march of bullshit through my industry was healthy. The tech gold rush had won. All I saw around me was greed and artificial caring. It wasn&#39;t worth it anymore.</p>
<p>The people that did care had been conned by the Harvard kids into using their talent for Mark&#39;s &#39;vision&#39; of a connected world. There was nothing to do but get off the ride.</p>
<p>Then we got the president fakery deserves. A man who could only win in a social media landscape that advantaged him.</p>
<p>His whole point was that everyone is a liar, all the rich kids in charge were fake too, selfish too, in it for themselves. You might as well hire an honest fake to call bullshit. Looking at my industry I couldn&#39;t say that he was wrong.</p>
<p>That pissed me off, and so I got to work. <a href="https://realness.online">Realness</a> is what I came up with.</p>

<h3 id="what-i-know-about-realness-from-using-it">What I know about Realness from using it</h3>
<ul>
<li>I post a lot less</li>

<p>Realness is a social network that&#39;s more like a tool than a popularity contest. It uses your phone number, so you get messaging, group text built in.  All of your information stays on your phone. I don&#39;t even know who your friends are. What is shared on the network are your posts and a simple profile for people to find you.</p>
