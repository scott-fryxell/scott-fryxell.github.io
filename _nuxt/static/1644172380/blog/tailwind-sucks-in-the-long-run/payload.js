I am lost in this html. There is duplication everywhere. I can't look at it and understand intuitively what is happening. The transition tag is a nightmare. All of this design mixed into all of this application makes it clumsy and ham-fisted to reason about when your re-reading it. It's like I'm stuck with a comic book when I'm trying to read the story."}]},{type:a,value:e},{type:b,tag:c,props:{},children:[{type:a,value:"Just changing the layout is gonna take 6 hours.
